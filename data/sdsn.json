throughout lives japan example country well functioning lifelong learning program goal create enriching dynamic society st century forming lifelong learning society people freely choose learning opportunities time lives proper recognition accorded learning achievements many aspects higher education developing countries need deal full discussion outside scope report next section recommendations would support expansion higher education promote lifelong learning meet needs sustainable society discussed recommendation governments support universities prioritize research based solutions sustainable development core purpose universities unique position support society evidence based scientific solutions problems sustainable development cutting edge research issues climate change solutions adaptation mitigation alternate energy sources public health challenges emerging rising temperatures management water resources ecosystems led academic institutions today however concentrated universities solutions complex interrelated ecological social economic problems societies face need developed locally imperative universities research centers developing countries claim space high quality locally relevant research offer solutions cities countries require prioritizing national regional issues ecology demographic change urbanization public health energy research climatology within research well developing mechanisms engaging policy makers communities private companies create application based practical solutions recommendation countries create enabling regulatory frameworks encourage public sector led growth higher education collaboration private sector public sector pivotal role promoting basic research knowledge production high quality research universities role needs strengthened funded adequately however clear public sector alone cannot meet demands higher education important therefore create enabling regulatory framework encourages private sector invest higher education long run short term profitable professional courses creating large number centers excellence different fields research expanding basic undergraduate graduate programs greater numbers young people range institutional designs private philanthropy led endowment based universities non profit profit institutions needed meet academic professional needs students regulatory structures need allow kind institutional diversity reward quality innovation create avenues advisory councils science channel research practical applications public sector also important responsibility ensure equitable access higher education therefore affordability across public private institutions recommendation academic institutions use technology expand access promote affordability allow lifelong learning expansion higher education simply kept pace demand new institutions require large investments building strong faculty takes time technology powerful tool expanding access rapidly significantly lower marginal cost internet connectivity still poor low income countries expanding quickly next decade half entirely possible large urban centers significant proportion rural areas access broadband case blended programs learning allow much faster expansion higher education countries already begun move direction examples include nigeria china india increasing access important school graduates also adults looking learn new skills competencies universities prepare provide lifelong learning adult populations technology allows online courses needed specialized mid career programs investing programs allow continuous improvement workforce productivity relatively low cost recommendation universities across countries collaborate research teaching free flow knowledge across borders great scope cross border collaboration universities collaborations make sense several counts allow universities retain build faculty providing varied rich peer network without physical relocation allow joint funding common research questions joint programs study give students exposure student groups teachers different cultural context enable faster spread better research teaching practices allow leapfrogging academic practices established new institutions conclusion future research needs previous chapters laid imperatives investing high quality education systems across age groups create sustainable society chapter identify areas future research help countries identify ways education contribute sustainable development determinants learning ages different contexts backgrounds components effective remedial programs large scale children steeped poor learning environments technological capabilities self learning appropriate effective ict
