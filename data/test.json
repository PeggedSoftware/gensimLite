[{"Global Governance": "policy brief recommendations on means of implementation in the new global partnership for sustainable development for the un general assembly open working group on sustainable development goals owg on sdgs additional briefs are available at http bit ly owgpolicybriefs the recommendations on means of implementation presented here have been compiled from two civil society consultations conducted by un ngls in a teleconference based consultation that resulted in the report advancing regional recommendations on the post agenda and an online consultation on four post reports to the secretary general a list of organizations that participated in these consultations is available here this policy brief also draws on recommendations from the consultation that un ngls undertook for the commission of experts of the president of the un general assembly on reforms of the international monetary and financial system in and the consultation it carried out for the un secretary generals high level advisory group on climate change financing agf in in addition it includes elements from a call for a global partnership for just and transformative development in the post era by the cso partnership for development effectiveness cpde while presenting a wide range of views this brief does not intend to represent the complete breadth of perspectives and recommendations from civil society on the subject of means of implementation in the new global partnership for sustainable development many consultation participants asserted that the adoption of global sustainable development goals sdgs will be meaningless unless strong means of implementation are in place the post development agenda must go well beyond the limited set of means of implementation captured under goal of the millennium development goals mdgs framework a global partnership for development and must be anchored to firm time bound targets and objectives civil society networks pointed out that in practice goal is the primary responsibility of industrialized countries but has shown the least progress in implementation even though this global partnership for development was supposed to create the enabling international environment to support implementation of the other mdgs this lop sided pattern must be reversed in the new global development framework so that means of implementation are realized well before the target date s of the new substantive global goals questions related to means of implementation cannot be disassociated from the need to tackle the major global macroeconomic systemic and structural reforms required to create the truly stable and as described in a un technical support team issues brief for the sixth session of the owg on sdgs the notion of means of implementation describes the interdependent mix of financial resources technology development and transfer capacity building inclusive and equitable globalization and trade regional integration as well as the creation of a national enabling environment required to implement the new sustainable development agenda particularly in developing countries united nations non governmental liaison service un ngls www un ngls org policy brief page of enabling international environment needed for the implementation of sustainable development goals these reforms were already called for by civil society ahead of the mdg review summit and are essential to accelerate progress in the achievement of the existing mdgs and to prevent major setbacks such as the food and financial crises in the current post crisis context of widespread practice of austerity by governments around the world the new global partnership for development is increasingly referred to in terms of partnerships with the private sector where private finance is expected to complement shrinking public resources the level of investment that will be required to achieve the global transition to sustainable development is unprecedented and will far exceed the non binding goal set by developed countries in the unfccc copenhagen accord to mobilize us billion a year by for climate change mitigation the us billion goal itself is widely viewed as arbitrary and inadequate for meeting the financing needs for climate mitigation in debates about climate and sustainable development finance it is often proposed that private sources must be tapped to generate long term stable and affordable finance civil society consultation contributors emphasized however that the private sector cannot be expected to support the transition to sustainable development on a purely voluntary basis and only strong democratically defined public policies including new laws and regulations can steer public and private investments on the scale and with the predictability required to manage the transition a number of safeguards must be put in place to ensure that public private partnerships support and do not undermine sustainable development and human rights just as importantly the new development agenda must call for the mobilization of new and innovative sources of public finance and must limit undue losses this will require new international taxes global rules to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations contribute their fair share of taxes and equitable treatment between debtors and creditors in the face of recurring sovereign debt crises which have caused major regressions in human rights to be effective the post agenda must also include much stronger accountability measures to ensure delivery on commitments the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be respected taking into account the historical responsibilities of industrialized countries lack of accountability has enabled developed countries to shirk their long standing commitment to contribute of annual gross domestic income to official development assistance oda this global development partnership commitment which dates back to is still widely unfulfilled and must be met unconditionally the new development framework must also prioritize greater domestic resource mobilization much can be done in this regard at country level but international cooperation is also required to overcome systemic flaws that prevent or discourage countries from taking bold progressive tax measures on their own detailed recommendations from civil society consultation participants are presented below organized according to the following six objectives reform the international financial architecture reform the international tax architecture reform the international development and climate finance architecture see reports of the un ngls consultation and informal interactive hearings of the general assembly with non governmental organizations civil society organizations and the private sector in preparation for the mdg summit united nations non governmental liaison service un ngls www un ngls

mobilization reform the international financial architecture a improve financial regulation including through the use of capital controls and reverse the financialization of the economy in a manner that allows for a sustained shift of resources from the financial economy back to the real economy prioritizing employment intensive low carbon and low resource intensive production b prioritize support to micro medium community based and cooperative enterprises where the overwhelming majority of jobs around the world are created notably through measures such as national and international guarantee funds grants and highly concessional long term loans c rein in the power of too big to fail institutions through enforceable national and international regulations that would sanction them as too big to allow and implement a range of measures to prevent the socialization of the costs of corporate wrongdoing d regulate food and commodities markets to curb price volatility while rendering illegal any high yielding financial instruments that lack social purpose e address the problem of unsustainable debt including by i reviewing onerous debts and cancelling those deemed illegitimate ii prioritizing resources for meeting development goals and human rights obligations over debt repayments especially in least developed countries ldcs iii establishing an independent and fair debt arbitration court that can provide a single statutory framework for debt crisis resolution by ensuring that both creditors and debtors cooperate to restructure sovereign debt while taking into account the unique economic conditions of debtor countries and iv preventing human rights violations during a debt crisis by declaring a debt standstill and pursuing counter cyclical fiscal and monetary policies with international assistance if needed rather than austerity measures f reform and democratize international financial institutions to ensure that they i give much greater voice to developing countries particularly ldcs ii genuinely respond to national and regional circumstances and priorities iii catalyze productive investments including in clean production systems and iv abide by the international human rights obligations of states g limit exchange rate volatility notably by developing and implementing an effective regulatory system for countries and blocks of countries that issue reserve currencies and transitioning from overdependence on the us dollar in international transactions towards a supranational reserve currency with revamped special drawing rights as a proxy leading towards such currency h promote new financial and monetary architectures at the regional level by i establishing regional monetary funds that would pool foreign currency reserves to combat speculative attacks and to compensate for economic asymmetries within the region ii extending intra regional trade through regional complementary currencies and iii establishing or consolidating regional development banks that finance transformative objectives in alignment with the realization of economic social and cultural rights and environmental regeneration i foster inter regional learning on best practices for new regional financial and monetary architectures drawing especially on such experiences from latin america reform the international tax architecture a implement financial transaction taxes regionally and at the global level united nations non governmental liaison service un ngls www un ngls org policy brief page of b agree internationally to automatic exchange of information of bank holdings country by country reporting of transnational corporations tncs and the closing of tax havens as indispensable measures to prevent tax avoidances and enable progressive redistributive taxes upgrade the un committee of experts on international cooperation in tax matters to an intergovernmental body c adopt regional and global agreements to reverse the race to the bottom in national tax concessions to foreign corporations which may extend to prevent other perverse incentives such as weakening labour and environmental standards to attract foreign investments reform the international development and climate finance architecture a refrain from treating foreign direct investment fdi as a substitute for oda the long standing commitment of developed countries to dedicate of gross domestic income to oda should be met unconditionally implement a new rights based approach of financial transfers beyond oda in the form of a mandatory system a fiscal equalization scheme or a compensation scheme to pay off climate debt and other forms of ecological debt b conclude a fair ambitious and binding international climate change agreement which should include a finance package that primarily focuses on non market mechanisms to address climate change and ensure that developed countries provide the required funds and technology to developing countries in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities c make a legally binding commitment to provide climate finance at a much higher level than the developed countries goal of mobilizing jointly us billion a year by to address the needs of developing countries in the context of climate change mitigation as pledged in the unfccc copenhagen accord d ensure that climate finance is balanced between mitigation and adaptation and that adaptation projects for both practical and ethical reasons are funded by grants rather than loans so that they do not place onerous debt burdens upon developing countries particularly the ldcs and small island developing states sids who have contributed the least to climate change but are the most vulnerable to climate disasters e activate the use of special drawing rights as an innovative source of development and climate finance reform the international trade and investment architecture a review international trade and investment agreements which restrict the ability of governments to regulate foreign investments in the public interest impose barriers to technology transfer prevent fair taxation and inconsistent with the objectives of sustainable development include other measures b address the problem of excessive concentration of corporate power such as global cartels that stifle innovation and crowd out alternative initiatives notably by developing international anti trust laws and institutions and by reinstating the equivalent of the former un centre on transnational corporations an independent entity to monitor tncs and help ensure that states respect their commitments to regulate them this accord was drafted by only five countries and was not adopted by delegates it was merely noted civil society widely views the us billion goal as arbitrary and far below what science and equity demands to address climate change according to the global humanitarian forum human impact report

international and national financing partnerships with the private sector are subject to mandatory accountability safeguards to ensure that financing is allocated to businesses that are creating decent work and contributing to the expansion of the domestic tax base rather than tax evasion ensure that criteria related to equitable distribution and affordability and not only to access are met further ensure that these safeguards prevent the socialization of costs in the case these projects fail b frame partnerships with the private sector within the un guiding principles on business and human rights implementing the united nations protect respect and remedy framework adopted by the un human rights council and the general assembly in and supplement these principles with binding enforcement measures including legislation court adjudication and penalties for violations c respect protect and promote social and environmental justice and human rights including by complementing the provisions of the declaration on the right to development the rights of communities affected by projects particularly marginalized and indigenous peoples must never be violated for development ensure democratic control of natural resources d create multi stakeholder governance structures ensuring equitable and inclusive representation that promotes gender equality and includes members of civil society and affected communities ensure that respective stakeholder groups rather than a secretariat or other management entity of the partnership nominate representatives to partnership bodies

implementation is in line with country priorities and national contexts with expertise sourced through transparent and inclusive processes that are gender balanced and involve affected communities particularly indigenous peoples increase domestic resource mobilization in some cases the following measures need to be backed by enabling international policies and rules outlined above to be fully effective in a context of globalized financial markets and unrestricted corporate capital movements implement progressive taxation measures on wealthier companies and individuals and reverse regressive tax measures such as high value added taxes vats especially on essential products ensure that progressive tax reform takes into consideration the impact of tax codes on human rights especially of the more vulnerable groups b phase out subsidies that support unsustainable production and consumption patterns and redirect these large amounts of resources to fund sustainable development while ensuring that poorer income groups are not negatively affected by these measures c adopt targets to shift government resources away from military spending and towards social a spending d include in the sustainable development goals domestic resource mobilization targets related to i progressive taxation ii corporate taxation and iii increasing the ratio of tax revenue to

service un ngls www un ngls org policy brief page of good governance and extreme poverty international movement atd fourth world governance in the context of extreme poverty effective governance at whatever geographical or political level cannot be brought about while extreme poverty exists all thought and discussion on governance must begin by examining how to reintegrate all people without exception into the social dialogues which take place within communities as well as both nationally and internationally extreme poverty has been defined as the combination of income poverty human development poverty and social exclusioni where a prolonged lack of basic security affects several aspects of peoples lives simultaneously severely compromising their chances of exercising or regaining their rights and of reassuming their responsibilities in the foreseeable future ii by its very definition extreme poverty is an obstacle to the active citizenship which effective governance requires among the consequences of extreme poverty is the associated isolation and exclusion exacerbated by a sense of shame and stigma iii as a participant with experience of poverty in a peer review project explained the challenge for me is the isolation the loneliness the painful awareness that we are not able to join in society or play any part in it iv extreme poverty above and beyond social needs or deprivations equates to the negation of all social existence due to the impossibility of full enjoyment of fundamental human rights social economic and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights its endurance is testament that respect of human rights is an obligation that is not applied to all people since some are seen as hopeless cases the fact that extreme poverty is first and foremost a human rights violation means that any attempt to build effective governance based on respect for humans and the ethics of responsibility must first seek its eradication v the millennium declaration resolved to to strive for the full protection and promotion in all our countries of civil political economic social and cultural rights for all with the goal of freeing the entire human race from want yet it is apparent that progress has been uneven in achieving the mdgs both between and within countries most notably for the very poorest and most marginalised people and populations vi the consequences of non effective governance in the context of extreme poverty challenges for a post mdg framework effective governance is difficult to attain when those most affected by extreme poverty have trouble getting their voices heard and their interests taken into account by service providers and decision makers globally public expenditure on health education and sanitation benefit the non poor far more than the poor who are powerless to change the situation vii this powerlessness when compounded by shame lack of self confidence and the fear of meeting others stemming from being on the receiving end of contempt from an early age exacerbates the exclusion experienced by people in extreme poverty as one participant in a recent participatory research project explained extreme poverty engenders a fear a shame in people doubts that contact cristina diez cristina diez atd fourthworld org stop them from expressing themselves when they should viii this renders effective fully inclusive governance highly problematic participatory research carried out with people experiencing chronic poverty has suggested that encounters with public services were perceived to be associated with the risk of losing resources being misunderstood harshly judged or penalised research participants felt that the humiliation lack of respect and contempt they faced could be seen as a form of violence an attack on their identity as a member of society or of the community and a denial of their individual humanity the barriers this created made mutual recognition understanding and communication impossible ix the idea that people living in poverty are unworthy of the rights benefits and aid to which they are fully entitled has a corrosive effect on the quality and fairness of governance at a local and national level the promotion of effective governance is exacerbated by the difficulties of very marginalised populations to hold governments as well as service providers from all sectors to account in the context of international development this absence of accountability risks creating projects or programmes intended to achieve poverty eradication goals that are ill adapted to the needs of those experiencing the most extreme poverty this stems from a limited and incomplete understanding of the realities of people living in extreme poverty donors all to often demand quick fix solutions whilst exhibiting a naive approach regarding the social impact of the projects they oversee and a voluntary blindness about true levels of project accountability staff are reluctant or unable to invest the time necessary to seek out the voices of the most impoverished x this makes it increasingly difficult for projects and programmes to tackle extreme poverty if only the most enterprising members of the community are reached inequalities may in fact be entrenched furthering the exclusion of the most vulnerable community members xi crucial to effective governance is ensuring the fundamental social bonds that link the individual to society it is therefore vital to recognise and reinforce the social and family ties which the most marginalised people and families use to resist the shocks inherent with the experience of extreme povertyxii when humanitarian or development projects and services fail to recognise their importance these ties are at risk of being undermined even unintentionally which can in turn lead to the rupture of this form of resistance and divide the poorest communities leaving their inhabitants further susceptible to extreme poverty xiii fair and effective governance also relies on an active and informed citizen body active citizenship not only reinforces social bonds but also encourages accountability and transparency and protects fundamental rights however in many countries people living in extreme poverty are unable to play their roles as active citizens barriers to citizenship include the cost of official documents such as identity papers and birth certificates high levels of illiteracy amongst the most marginalised communities and reluctance amongst local officials to acknowledge populations living in informal settlements people living in extreme poverty also report that the lack of information about their rights as citizens also affects their ability to play an active role in civic society further problems are posed by the prejudicial views held by administrators and public officials about the intelligence ability and motivation of impoverished individuals and communities xiv addressing the challenges of effective governance from a human rights perspective effective governance can only be achieved if all citizens are able to attain full and effective enjoyment of all fundamental rights for this reason it is essential that a post framework conforms to recognised human rights norms and standards and considers sustainable development within the context of meeting human rights obligations the advantages of such an approach for effective governance are manifold a human rights contact cristina diez cristina diez atd fourthworld org approach is based on equity non discrimination and universalism priority is afforded to the members of society who encounter the most obstacles in achieving their rights a human rights approach also stresses the principle of the participation of those affected to be actively involved as rights holders in addressing their situation it encourages duty bearers to involve people in extreme poverty as citizens with knowledge to offer in finding solutions which as a result of their active participation are more likely to be effective of course the necessary conditions must be met for such participation to be meaningful and genuinely serve poverty eradication efforts the recently adopted un guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights provide a practical tool for policy makers in designing their public policies particularly their poverty eradication efforts based on international human rights norms and values the principles provide guidance on the application of states human rights obligations in the fight against extreme poverty they highlight the specific rights whose enjoyment by persons living in poverty are particularly limited and obstructed and in relation to which state policies are often inadequate or counterproductive xv the guiding principles also clearly outline the barriers that people living in extreme poverty face in claiming their rights and give detailed steps of ways by which state as well as non state actors can counteract them given that they are based on agreed human rights norms and standards they provide a common basis for dialogue between rights holders and duty bearers by also providing specific implementation requirements they provide a clear framework for stakeholders seeking to promote effective governance through the implementation of human rights promoting participatory good governance in the post development framework families and individuals living in extreme poverty aspire to play an active role in creating effective and fair forms of governance ensuring their ability to genuinely participate all forms of governance from international institutions to groups responsible for overseeing local development projects is extremely important their participation not only counteracts the stigmatisation faced by impoverished communities but also improves the impact and sustainability of the policies and programmes designed to address their needs and encourage development the following recommendations created in partnership with people living in extreme poverty xvi aim to counteract the challenges that extreme poverty poses to the maintenance of fair and effective forms of government ensure transparency at all levels of governance whilst creating accountability mechanisms at national and international levels the reason decisions are taken and the effects of participation must be clear for all to see independent ombudsmen judicial processes and peer review systems between countries can all help ensure that participatory governance is not just tokenistic develop participatory mechanisms at all levels of governance in line with the provisions set out in the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights states must ensure the active free informed and meaningful participation of persons living in poverty at all stages of the design implementation monitoring and evaluation of decisions and policies affecting them particular care should be taken to fully include the poorest and most socially excluded persons ensure that local national and international structures encourage participatory governance the incentives for staff in local national and international institutions and administrations should be modified to make their governance processes more conducive to implementing participatory approaches contact cristina diez cristina diez atd fourthworld org enable impoverished communities to participate meaningfully in governance participation cannot be imposed and time must be taken to listen to entire communities not just community leaders building the capacity of communities to self organise and build links with wider society should be a priority the role of csos that provide space for

redefining the role of business for sustainable development klaus m leisinger chairman novartis foundation for sustainable development m peter bakker president of the world business council for sustainable development january introduction the scale and complexity of the sustainable development challenges of our planet are such that it is clear that no single group of actors or institutions can make a decisive difference game changing progress towards sustainable development demands a multi stakeholder approach the international community multi lateral institutions national governments academia civil society and business have got to work together towards a common agenda within the sustainable development solutions network sdsn business will play a role in almost all of the identified thematic working groups the innovations management skills and financial resources of business will be a major provider of solutions to most areas in the th thematic working group we will develop suggestions for the role of business in the transition towards a sustainable economy this paper outlines the direction of our working group under the following headings a b c d e within the space of sustainable development the role of business working group will take the following elements into account how to incentivize and support sustainable economic development how to ensure that future economic growth and technological progress aim to be socially inclusive achieving poverty eradication youth unemployment reductions and more equal societies the state of the art of responsible business the required r evolution in the role of business or long term pathway to sustainability the mechanisms to scale up solutions the link between sdgs and business the action agenda for the role of business working group how to achieve environmental sustainability aimed at developing low carbon solutions reducing stress on all planetary boundaries as well as scaling up resource productivity and agricultural improvements how to ensure good governance which is essential for sustainable development this applies to national and international governments as well as to corporate governance the state of the art of responsible business a twenty years ago in the first rio summit business had only a very marginal presence twenty years later a lot has changed the awareness for sustainability in business has increased an ever larger group of businesses is joining the standard for responsible business that is defined by the principles of the un global compact leading companies are integrating sustainability in the core of their strategies and more and more business solutions for a sustainable world are developed partnerships with the un and other elements of civil society are now considered normal and so is business representation in major meetings business has traditionally focused on providing goods and services that meet customer demands can be sold at competitive prices in a profitable way while adhering to law and regulation successful entrepreneurship is the most important driver of economic growth and hence improvement of living standards however in a world that is resource constraint where climate change is now clearly linked to human activity and where growth has so far been unable to include all citizens on our planet this traditional role of business is not good enough to achieve a sustainable world nor can it be expected that without any additional intervention entrepreneurship will be able to solve all our challenges over corporate participants worldwide have joined the un global compact through which its ten principles have de facto become the standard for responsible business behavior an expansion of these principles is developed in the lead initiative of the global compact where companies are encouraged to undertake more outward oriented actions to increase their positive impact in society examples of such actions pursue social investments and philanthropic contributions that tie in with the core competences or operating context of the company coordinate with other organizations and initiatives to amplify efforts strive for partnerships with un entities governments ngo s and industry peers wbcsd a group of forward thinking companies developed a vision which outlines a pathway to reach a sustainable global society by in which the earths billion people live well and within the limits of the planet the pathway will enable us to live within the limits of one planet limiting the destruction of key ecosystem services including climate forest fisheries and farmlands and easing human hardship through inclusive growth the most progressive companies have begun a full integration of sustainability in the operations and strategy of business not as social investment or philanthropic contribution but integrated in the strategy and operations of its core business b in vision a call for a new agenda for business is included to work with government and society worldwide to transform markets and competition prices must be rationalized to include such externalities as key ecosystem services so that sustainability can become a true competitive advantage across all industries and regions such pricing of externalities will also allow more conscious consumer choices and support the launch and sales of more sustainable products and services the transformation that capitalism has to go through to align with a sustainable development of the economy will not be achieved through mere incremental change but requires a radical transformation of the way markets work like every journey such transformation will most likely happen in a numbers of steps more companies are to be inspired to not do harm and compete with integrity and sign up the required r evolution in the role of business or long term pathway to sustainability to the un global compact standards for responsible behavior and report their sustainability performance annually through partnerships and strategic philanthropy the positive impact on society by companies can be further enlarged companies should be integrating sustainability in their core business strategies so that their core business becomes the engine of solutions for the challenges in the social and environmental impact of their business and products solutions that are reality based will take of first these have viable business cases today as a result of lower costs fuel efficiency etc or new business sales opportunities additionally an exploration of quick bold simple remedies for the most pressing sustainability challenges that can buy us time will be in this step as well business and capital markets need to formalize the way that sustainability challenges are reflected in the long term risk assessment of a company it is important that these risk assessments are well grounded in the scientific outlook on social and environmental boundaries the last step is systemic change aimed at creating a better way to measure and value the true performance of business it seems now clear that change will not be sufficient if business or the capital markets supporting it will continue to only focus on a short term return on financial capital business uses not only financial capital but also natural capital resources ecosystems and social capital humans and must begin to optimize the returns of business in a balanced way across all three of these capitals recognizing that all three capitals have a cost of capital associated with them the most progressed example of this true costing has been implemented by puma in its e p l in which all ecological impacts throughout its value chain were measured monetized and taken as a charge against its financial profit the e p l is now being developed to more sectors and geographies through a newly launched initiative called the b team other initiatives like iirc integrated reporting teeb for business gri and sasb will develop the concept of pricing externalities for inclusion in the accounting framework of business using pricing as a mechanism to come to better business and consumer decisions and valuations is relatively well developed for key elements of natural capital however some significant hurdles for implementation remain in stranded assets and re alignment of the tax systems when it comes to including social capital in the way business will manage its performance and impact on societies the tools and methods are generally more scattered and less developed within sdsn the link to the academic world will be used to make progress in this field towards standards that can be linked to and support the sdg achievements the mechanisms to scale up solutions c business has and will be the major provider of solutions for many of the sustainability challenges new technologies will bring alternative solutions forward new business models will emerge and continued close cooperation with governments will bring regulations that will incentivize the development and deployment of new solutions and behavior in generic terms there are five ways that if embedded within an incentivizing framework of public policies will allow for fast scaling up of business solutions get more companies into sustainability encourage more companies to accept the ten principles of the un global compact do not harm and compete with integrity andencourage more companies to partner with the un entities and other ngos strategic philanthropy communicate why sustainability makes good business sense the business case get leading companies to do more share the best practices of the leading companies to further enhance the business case for sustainability story telling inspire the leading companies to push the boundaries of innovation sector based solutions share best practices within each sector elevate the best practices to the standard of operation for the sector cross sector innovation bring leading companies from different sectors together to create innovative solutions for complex system challenges like cities buildings water nexus etc develop indexes for ranking these solutions to encourage speed of implementation i e sustainable city index systemic changes develop the universal accounting and valuation framework for balancing financial social and natural capital develop the curriculum for future business leaders education even though the scaling mechanisms above are all business based solutions it remains of pivotal importance to state that only through close collaboration aimed at aligning the objectives of all actors governments civil society and academia the full impact can be achieved in this context is important that sdsn also reviews opportunities where governments can better tap into the financing innovation and expertise from the private sector within the sdsn working group on the role of business each of the solutions coming out of the other working groups will be reviewed against the above mentioned scale up mechanisms in order to recommend actions by business and public policies for accelerated implementation d the hlp and other un processes are moving towards the formulation of the sustainable development goals that ought to apply to all actors in society including business for business to be truly engaged it is important to create a framework for the translation of the sdgs in a way that the required business contributions become quantified actionable and time bound furthermore it could be considered to create some sdgs that specifically target behavior and or contribution of business the sdsn role of business working group can offer the following support in the creating this framework sdgs could include specific targets for number of companies to sign up to principles of the link between the sdgs and business do no harm and compete with integrity sdgs can be aimed to be implemented through specific partnerships between business and un entities sdsn could work with the un office for partnerships to create specific proposals each sdg should be broken down to relevant business sectors and regions so they can provide solution for the achievement of that goal each sector should be invited to make proposals for the social environmental economic and governance contribution specific to that sector and the sdg for each of the sdgs a specific set of measurement tools should be reviewed so that business can include these in their management information systems that drive actions towards achievement a specific sdg for the transformation of markets to include pricing of externalities for both natural and social capital could be considered as a way to accelerate acceptance of these concepts the action agenda for the role of business working group e as is clear from the paragraphs above the sdsn role of business working group will focus on the following elements detailing of the long term pathway to sustainability through business solutions creating recommendations for scaling up all business solutions recommendations out of all sdsn working groups creation of a framework to translate the sdgs into actionable quantified and time bound objectives for business contributions next to these main topics the working group will review the impact of a number of other topics responsible advertising aimed at promoting more responsible product choices by existing customers as well as the creation of a more sustainable lifestyle in emerging markets responsible lobbying that will ensure companies do not lobby against positions that they express in their sustainability or general business strategies responsible tax optimization code that will review possibilities to

deutsche gesellschaft fr iii iv v the deep decarbonization pathways project ddpp is a collaborative initiative to understand and show how individual countries can transition to a low carbon economy and how the world can meet the internationally agreed target of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature to less than degrees celsius c achieving the c limit will require that global net emissions of greenhouse gases ghg approach zero by the second half of the century this will require a profound transformation of energy systems by mid century through steep declines in carbon intensity in all sectors of the economy a transition we call deep decarbonization currently the ddpp comprises country research teams composed of leading researchers and research institutions from countries representing of global ghg emissions and different stages of development australia brazil canada china france germany india indonesia japan mexico russia south africa south korea the uk and the usa the country research teams are acting independently of governments and do not necessarily reflect the positions or views of their national governments each ddpp country research team is developing a pathway analysis for deep decarbonization we expect the number of country research teams to grow over the coming months and years several partner organizations contribute to the analysis and outreach of the ddpp including the german development institute gdi the international energy agency iea the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa and the world business council on sustainable development wbcsd we invite other organizations to become ddpp partners and contribute to practical problem solving for deep decarbonization the sustainable development

this stage we have not yet looked in detail at the issue of the costs and benefits of mitigation actions nor considered the question of who should pay for these costs the ddpp report will take a broader perspective and go beyond technical feasibility to analyze in further detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches identify national and international financial requirements and map out policy frameworks for implementation we hope that the deep decarbonization pathways ddps outlined in this report and the ongoing analytical work by the country research teams will support discussions in every country on how to achieve deep decarbonization above all we hope that the findings will be helpful to the parties of the un framework convention on climate change unfccc as they craft a strong agreement on climate change mitigation at the cop in paris in december vii taking the c limit seriously staying within the c

pathway project ddpp summarizes preliminary findings of the pathways developed by the ddpp country research teams with the objective of achieving emission reductions consistent with limiting global warming to less than c the ddpp is a knowledge network comprising country research teams and several partner organizations who develop and share methods assumptions and findings related to deep decarbonization each ddpp country research team develops illustrative pathway analysis for the transition to a low carbon economy with the intent of taking into account national socio economic conditions development aspirations infrastructure stocks resource endowments and other relevant factors the interim report focuses on technically feasible pathways to deep decarbonization this executive summary starts with a short outline of key results from previous global studies discussed in chapter i to iv and then turns to what is new and special about the country level approach of the ddpp explained in chapter v it summarizes the main preliminary findings from the deep decarbonization pathways ddps developed by the country research teams included in chapter vi and draws some lessons for the international negotiations leading up to the st conference of the parties cop of the un framework convention on climate change unfccc to be held in paris in december the economic social and environmental risks of unabated climate change are immense they threaten to roll back the fruits of decades of growth and development undermine prosperity and jeopardize countries ability to achieve even the most basic socio economic development goals in the future including the eradication of poverty and continued economic growth these risks affect all developed and developing countries alike avoiding dangerous climate change and achieving sustainable development are inextricably linked there is no prospect of winning the fight against climate change if countries fail on poverty eradication or if countries do not succeed in raising the living standards of their people addressing climate change requires deep emission reductions of all greenhouse gases ghgs including the deep decarbonization of energy systems to be successful this transition must ensure that socio economic development needs are met within the constraints of very low emissions the results from previous global studies including the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc assessment reports ar show that deeply reducing ghg emissions and achieving socio economic development are not mutually exclusive robust economic growth and rising prosperity are consistent with the objective of deep decarbonization they form two sides of the same coin and must be pursued together as part of sustainable development the ddps developed by the country research teams assume continued sometimes rapid economic growth the forthcoming report from the global commission on the new climate economy provides additional insights on how to pursue these twin objectives xi in all governments operationalized the objective of the unfccc to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by adopting the target of keeping the global rise in mean surface temperature below c compared with the pre industrial average they did this in recognition of the extreme risks to future human wellbeing resulting from a rise in temperature above c the latest scientific research analyzed by the ipcc fifth assessment report ar working group wg concludes that even an increase in global temperatures of c constitutes a serious threat to human wellbeing keeping below c of global warming is indispensable to maintain climate change within the boundaries of manageable risks and to our ability to adapt to climate change limiting the increase in global mean temperature to less than c imposes a tough constraint on cumulative ghg emissions including co emissions which are the largest single source of ghg emissions to have a likely chancedefined as a probability higher than two thirdsof staying within this limit the level of cumulative co emissions from land use fossil fuels and industry must be in the range of billion tons gigatons or gt by mid century if one excludes a significant contribution from net negative emissions the co budget to is gt staying within this co budget requires very near term peaking and a sharp reduction in co emissions thereafter especially in energy related co emissions the scenarios reviewed by the ipcc that give a likely chance of staying within the c limit project co emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes co energy emissions close to gt in on average down from gt in the iea energy technology perspective etp c scenario ds which gives only a chance of staying within the c limit reaches gt co energy in assuming a world population of billion people by in line with the medium fertility forecast of the un population divisionthis means that countries would need to converge close to a global average of co energy emissions per capita of tons in which is a sharp decrease compared to today s global average of tons especially for developed countries with current emissions per capita much higher than today s global average the world is not on track to stay within the c limit while awareness of climate change is rising and a large and growing number of countries cities and corporations have pledged to reduce their ghg emissions these pledges taken together are not sufficient to stay within the c limit the ipcc ar working group wg calculates that in the absence of additional commitments to reduce ghg emissions the world is on a trajectory to an increase in global mean temperature of c to c compared to pre industrial levels when accounting for full climate uncertainty this range extends from c to c by the end of the century the consequences of such a temperature rise would be catastrophic a recent report prepared by the potsdam institute for climate impact research pik for the world bank describes a dramatic the sustainability of the large scale deployment of some net negative emissions technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestratation beccs raises issues still under debate in part due to the competition in land uses for energy and food purposes schellnhuber hj et al turn down the heat climate extremes regional impacts and the case for resilience full report washington dc world bank june xii picture of a c warmer world where climate and weather extremes would cause devastation and intense human suffering it would have severe repercussions on human and physical systems and potentially unleash positive feedback mechanisms that further amplify the human drivers the ipcc ar and a large number of other international and national assessments validate this finding it is therefore vital that the world become much more serious about the implications of staying within the c limit governments businesses and civil society must understand and operationalize the profound transformations required to reach this target we do not subscribe to the view held by some that the c limit is impossible to achieve and that it should be weakened or dropped altogether the science is clear that global warming beyond c carries the risk of grave and irreversible harm to human wellbeing and development prospects in all countries the political risks of jettisoning the c limit are also significant if the world fails to mobilize in support of the c limit or if countries try to weaken it there will be no realistic prospect for the international community to agree to another quantitative target countries would find themselves on a slippery downward slope with no quantitative foothold to organize an international and coordinated response to climate change the c limit is an invaluable tool for international mobilization that must be preserved the latest scientific research indicates that keeping below the c limit is challenging but feasible global studiesincluding the scenarios reviewed by the ipccc ar wg the iea world energy outlook weo and energy technology perspectives etp reports and the global energy assessment gea led by the institute of applied systems analysis iiasa show that reducing global ghg emissions to a level consistent with the c limit is still within reach clearly though the window of opportunity is closing fast countries therefore need to act quickly and in a determined and coordinated manner to keep the c limit within reach very few countries have looked seriously at the operational implications of staying within the c limit all large emitting countries now have quantified targets to reduce their ghg emissions by the year but these targetswhich sometimes are yet to be backed by detailed policy actions and implementation plansare collectively insufficient to put countries on a trajectory consistent with the long term global objective of deep decarbonization in fact most emissions reductions targets were framed as a deviation from business as usual bau trends reductions in the carbon intensity of gdp or relatively modest decrease in absolute ghg emissions compared to a base year by and large national targets are not derived from an assessment of what will be needed to stay within the c limit only an internationally coordinated goal oriented approach to operationalizing the c limit will allow humanity to avoid dangerous climate change as this interim ddpp report and many other analyses make clear staying within c will require deep transformations of energy and production systems industry agriculture land use and other dimensions of human development it will require profound changes in the prevailing socio economic development frameworks many of the technologies that will need to underpin these transformations are available but many others are not http documents worldbank org curated en turn down heat climate extremes regional impacts case resilience full report xiii ready for large scale deployment making critical low carbon technologies commercially available and affordable enabling countries to pursue long term transformations will require long term international cooperation and trust one important purpose of the ddpp is to lay out an analytical approach to operationalizing the c limit that can underpin a goal oriented international response to mitigating climate change taking into account country specific socio economic conditions and development aspirations the ddpp aims to help countries think through how to pursue their national development priorities while achieving the deep decarbonization of energy systems by mid century consistent with the c limit following the launch of the ddpp in october the ddpp country research teams have collaborated to identify key principles and requirements for successful ddps a broad consensus has emerged on the role of ddps and criteria for success staying within the c limit requires that countries develop long term pathways to deep decarbonization to explore options and develop a long term strategy the nature and magnitude of the decarbonization challenge are such that there is no quick and easy fix deep decarbonization will not happen overnight and there is no silver bullet deep decarbonization is not about modest and incremental change or small deviations from bau in particular it requires major changes to countries energy and production systems that need to be pursued over the long term decisions made today with regards to say power generation and transport infrastructure will have a long term impact on future ghg emissions which must be mapped out carefully and understood quantitatively the ddps developed by the country research teams backcast from the global goal of limiting the rise in temperature below c to explore the transformations for deep decarbonization required to reach the goal we use the term backcasting to describe a process where the future ghg emission target is set and then the changes needed to achieve that target are determined backcasting is not to be confused with rigid central planning a process of deep decarbonization must be adaptive as strategies and pathways will have to be continually revised and updated based on new results from climate science technological innovation and lessons learnt from implementation the ddpp follows a two stage approach to problem solving the first which is the focus of this report is to identify technically feasible ddps for achieving the objective of limiting the rise in global temperatures below c at this stage we have not looked in detail at the issue of costs and benefits not considered the question of who should pay for them in a secondlaterstage we will refine the analysis of the technical potential exploring the options for even deeper decarbonization pathways and better taking into account infrastructure stocks we will also take a broader perspective beyond technical feasibility by quantifying costs and benefits estimating national and international finance requirements mapping out domestic and global policy frameworks and considering in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met these issues will be described in the ddpp report but technically feasible ddps are a vital first step towards achieving the c limit by illuminating the scale and nature of technological and structural changes required and their related investment needs xiv the technical ddps developed by the country research teams rest on a number of national and global policy assumptions that will be investigated in more detail in the ddpp report these policy assumptions include all countries take strong early and coordinated actions to achieve deep decarbonization all countries adopt adequate nationally appropriate policies regulations and incentives financial flows are re directed from high carbon to low carbon portfolios and projects financial support is provided to countries that appropriately require financial assistance to implement mitigation policies and finance low carbon investments the ddps developed by the country research teams presented in this report are intended to provide a complementary analysis to existing global level studies of deep emissions reductions to make a strong and convincing case for action at the national level ddps must be country specific and developed and owned by local experts they need to fit within countries development strategies and align with their other socio economic and environmental goals they need to demonstrate that the short and long term challenges countries face such as economic development poverty eradication job creation inequality reduction energy and food security and biodiversity protection can be addressed in parallel to deep decarbonization ddps must take into account country specific infrastructure stocks and natural resource endowments they must also take into account the systemic implications and the inherent gradual pace of changing technology infrastructure and capital stocks within countries none of this can be accomplished through aggregate global models and studies which are not granular enough to present a detailed technical roadmap for policy implementation at the country level ddps are indispensable for promoting a national dialogue on decarbonization and launching a process of intense and complex problem solving transparent ddps can enable a public discussion in every country on how best to achieve emission reduction objectives understand possible trade offs and identify synergies or win wins such technical analysis and national dialogue on deep decarbonization will involve business civil society and various expert communities e g engineers geologists climatologists economists social scientists to debate the best options for decarbonization identify bottlenecks and propose new approaches ddps can become a framework for organizing a dynamic process of discussion and problem solving in every country ddps equally are indispensable for building trust across countries shaping their expectations and identifying where international cooperation and assistance is required ddps show how each country aims to achieve deep decarbonization and demonstrate the seriousness of national commitments to reduce ghg emissions transparent ddps can enhance trust among countries which is critical for a concerted international response to climate change they will also help highlight areas that require international assistance and increased international cooperation particularly on rdd d of low carbon technologies xv in aggregate the initial ddps developed by the country research teams outlined in this report achieve deep absolute emissions reductions by total co energy emissions from the preliminary ddps already reach a level of gt by down from gt in this represents a decrease of total co energy emissions over the period and a and reduction in emissions per capita and the carbon intensity of gdp respectively the interim ddps do not yet achieve the full decarbonization needed to make staying below the c limit likely defined as a higher than two thirds probability of success the country research teams have identified additional opportunities for deep decarbonization that will be incorporated in the next version of the ddps see chapter vi to be published in nonetheless the aggregate decarbonization pathway is already very substantial and well on its way to becoming consistent with the c target the preliminary ddps already provide key insights and identify unique elements of deep decarbonization in each country these include the key components of nationally appropriate strategies and the most promising country specific technology options for deep decarbonization the initial ddps also identify the principal challenges that still need to be addressed by the ddpp finally the ddps provide initial indications of the enabling conditions for the successful implementation of deep decarbonization understanding and meeting these conditions will require further refinement through careful analysis public consultation and learning by doing the ddps developed by the country research teams share three common pillars of deep decarbonization of national energy systems energy efficiency and conservation greatly improved energy efficiency in all energy end use sectors including passenger and goods transportation through improved vehicle technologies smart urban design and optimized value chains residential and commercial buildings through improved end use equipment architectural design building practices and construction materials and industry through improved equipment production processes material efficiency and re use of waste heat low carbon electricity decarbonization of electricity generation through the replacement of existing fossil fuel based generation with renewable energy e g hydro wind solar and geothermal nuclear power and or fossil fuels coal gas with carbon capture and storage ccs fuel switching switching end use energy supplies from highly carbon intensive fossil fuels in transportation buildings and industry to lower carbon fuels including low carbon electricity other low carbon energy carriers synthesized from electricity generation or sustainable biomass or lower carbon fossil fuels within the three pillars that are common to all countries individual ddps show a wide variety of different approaches based on national circumstances differentiating national circumstances xvi include socio economic conditions the availability of renewable energy resources and national preferences regarding the development of renewable energy nuclear power ccs and other technologies for example the ddp developed by the indian team decarbonizes power generation using primarily renewable energy and nuclear power but not ccs because the scale of the potential for geological carbon sequestration in india is still uncertain at the other end of the spectrum the ddps developed by the canadian chinese indonesian mexican russian and uk teams project a significant share of coal and gas fired power generation with ccs by the preliminary ddps also reveal the sectors in which deep emissions reductions are most challenging particularly freight and industry relative to the state of knowledge about low carbon strategies in other areas such as power generation buildings and passenger transport decarbonization strategies for freight and industry are less well developed and understood these two sectors constitute a key focus area for future analysis by the ddpp and a future challenge for global rdd d efforts some potential solutions have been identified for freight and industry decarbonization options for freight include improved propulsion technologies battery electric hybrid compressed or liquefied natural or synthetized gas and hydrogen modal shifts e g from road transport to trains and ships and sustainable biofuels and synthesized fuels for air and maritime transport decarbonization options for industry include improved efficiency electrification of boilers re use of process waste heat sustainable biomass both energy crops and waste material and ccs some of the identified decarbonization options for industry and freight have yet to be included in all ddps some country research teams will include additional decarbonization options in their revised ddps they will also ensure consistency of national projections for industrial production in particular for energy and mining products with the forecasted global demand and the domestic needs for infrastructure development by given the technological challenges associated with deep emission reductions in the freight and industry sectors complementary measures to reduce or limit the growth of demand for their products and services will be explored taking into account countries socio economic goals and strategies the analysis by the country research teams also confirms that the technical feasibility of deep decarbonization rests on the large scale deployment of several low carbon technologies some of which are not yet fully commercialized or affordable for this reason countries and the international community as a whole must undertake a major research development demonstration and diffusion rdd d effort to develop low carbon technologies and ensure their widespread availability and their affordability xvii all country research teams have adopted project wide assumptions regarding the development and deployment of critical low carbon technologies there will be sufficient global rdd d and international cooperation to make all the relevant pre commercial low carbon technologies commercially viable and widely available in a timely and scaled manner critical low carbon technologies will become competitive and affordable through the combined effects of carbon pricing policy incentives and cost reduction through learning effects and economies of scale low carbon technologies will be made available to all countries through mechanisms for technology cooperation including funding as necessary and all barriers to technology diffusion will be removed some key technologies which are critical for deep decarbonization in all ddps are not yet technically mature or economically affordable they include advanced energy storage flexible load management and integrated portfolio design for balancing power systems with high penetrations of variable renewable energy e g wind and solar very high performance appliances controls and materials for buildings zero emissions vehicles with adequate range notably battery electric or fuel cell light duty vehicles sustainable biofuels or synthesized fuels for air and marine transport some emerging low carbon technologies are key in a subset of the ddps these include new types of renewable energy technologies e g advanced geothermal deep offshore wind and tidal energy carbon capture and sequestration on fossil fueled power plants and industries advanced nuclear power technology that sustains public confidence and support the country teams underscore that successful implementation of national ddps depends on directed technological changethat is technological change that is propelled through an organized sustained and funded effort engaging government academia and business with targeted technological outcomes in mind no country research team was comfortable assuming that their country alone could develop the requisite low carbon technologies likewise market forces alone will not be sufficient to promote the required rdd d at the right scale timing and coordination across economies and sectorseven when these market forces are guided by potential large profits from the generation of new intellectual property technological success will therefore require a globally coordinated effort in technology development built on technology roadmaps for each of the key pre commercial low carbon technologies directed technological change should not be conceived as picking winners but as making sure the market has enough winners to pick from to achieve cost effective low carbon outcomes while directed technological change is essential to meeting the challenge of deep decarbonization there are many alternative technologies under development now and that may emerge in the future technology roadmaps and policy coordination should always leave room for new developments efforts aimed at building public support and acceptance for key technologies will also play an important role xviii the preliminary results and the approach of the ddpp itself reveal the critical importance of preparing country level ddps to these pathways and the discussion of their results and input assumptions are essential tools for learning and problem solving this process is crucial to developing a long term vision for deep decarbonization and shaping the expectations of countries businesses and investors about future development opportunities the ddpp and similar processes afford a unique opportunity for teams to work together across countries to map out how the global c limit can be operationalized and achieved at the country level it highlights the need to introduce long term backcasting into the scope of the climate negotiations preparing cop the current focus of the international negotiations on mitigation is on emission reduction targets to or yet if countries do not work with a longer time horizon and backcast from this long term target they are likely to adopt strategies that fall far short of what is needed to stay below the c limit by its structure the current incremental approach will fail to consider the deep systemic changes and the key technologies that are still pre commercial but necessary to reach the target what the ddpp process illustrates is that at least two new elements will need to be part of the global deal in at cop in paris these do not cover the full scope of the agreement in particular the need to provide adequate support financial technological and capacity building to countries that appropriately require it to undertake the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions but they are nonetheless an essential component of a successful global deal to operationalize the c target and deep decarbonization would lower the needs and costs of unavoidable adaptation country ddps a shared global commitment that each country will develop and make publicly available a non binding ddp to that is consistent with the c limit and their national circumstances official country ddps as distinct from illustrative ddps developed by researchers would be predicated on a shared commitment to the global target and to all aspects of global cooperation needed to achieve it including technology cooperation financial support and policy coordination global large scale rdd d of low carbon technologies a massive and sustained global public private effort to develop demonstrate and diffuse various low carbon technologies that are not yet technically mature or competitive and are key to the success of deep decarbonization it is our hope that this interim report and upcoming ddpp reports will make a useful contribution to operationalizing the c target in particular we hope that the ddpp can help spur the design and international comparison of national ddps and promote the necessary global cooperation to achieve them to further this discussion we invite comments and suggestions for improvement on this interim report before august xix xx staying within the c limit the solemn responsibility of the global community business as usual means catastrophic climate change is likely even a c increase in global temperatures entails major risks why the world needs to stick to the c limit how to pursue the c limit seriously our moment of truth has arrived twenty two years ago at the rio earth summit the worlds governments recognized that humanity was changing the climate system profoundly posing risks for human wellbeing and sustainable development prospects they adopted the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc two years later and resolved to protect the planet and promote sustainable development by stabilizing ghg concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system yet more than two decades later ghg emissions are still far from stabilizing in at the first conference of the parties cop of the unfccc co emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and direct co emissions from industrial processes were billion tons gigatons or gt and the co concentration stood at parts per million ppm by at cop global co emissions had soared to billion tons and co concentrations stood at ppm every country has signed on to fight against human induced climate change but the world remains dangerously off course from the ultimate objective of the unfccc there is as of yet no prospect of stabilizing ghg concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous human induced climate change the parties to the unfccc have now had annual meetings since these cops have borne the worlds hopes and disappointments in our collective inability to date to head off a growing catastrophe at the th cop held in cancun in the worlds governments committed to a new and clear target to keep the global rise in mean surface temperature below c compared with the pre industrial average the cop added a proviso that the c limit may be revised downward to c in light of available science the c limit is the worlds most explicit and many climate scientists would say last ditch effort to operationalize the goal of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa earth system research laboratory esrl data http www esrl noaa gov a clear goal is set but the means to achieve it have not yet been established since the parties have struggled to create a framework of climate mitigation that is up to the task for several years now all eyes have been on the road to paris cop in december the date that the worlds governments assigned themselves to reach an agreement to implement the c limit december is our last chance in the sense that a success at paris would enable the world to just barely maintain the chance to keep the temperature rise within the c limit a failure in paris would almost certainly put the c limit out of reach despite the c commitment reiterated at every cop since cancun global ghg emissions have continued to rise sharply the climate science is clear and unequivocal without a dramatic reversal of the ghg emissions trajectoryone that leads to a significant decline in ghg emissions by mid century and to net zero emissions during the second half of the centurythe world will not only overshoot the c limit but will do so dramatically the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ar shows that without major efforts to reduce ghg emissions beyond those already committed the world is on a path to an average temperature increase of c to c compared to pre industrial levels when accounting for full climate uncertainty this range extends from c to c the business as usual bau course is so deeply entrenched that one study after another blithely assumes that the world will overshoot the c limit one can review any authoritative report on energy trendsby the international energy agency iea the us energy information association eia or industry groups such as bp or shelland the result is the same all reports present a baseline or bau trajectory of roughly c this outcome is somehow received as normal despite the global commitment stating otherwise clearly our global politics and our energy practices are out of line though they are implicitly accepted as normal yet this is anything but normal humanity faces catastrophic risks on our current path the risks of unabated climate change are enormous they threaten every prospect of achieving sustainable development and humanitys fervent hopes to end poverty and achieve a decent life for all on this planet the current trajectory is not just risky it is potentially catastrophic runaway climate change would threaten the life support systems of the planet food production human health and productivity and safety from extreme storms and other climate disruptions rising sea levels would overtake many of the worlds largest urban agglomerations and low lying countries such as bangladesh and small island states many threatened regions in todays poor world particularly the tropics drylands forests and alpine regions may become uninhabitable leading to mass migration and suffering some in the developed world might be skeptical that such dangers will reach them yet they are mistaken crises in any part of the world can quickly become global as when droughts floods or violence resulting from food shortages result in conflict mass migration movements soaring food prices and more disasters such as hurricanes katrina and sandy in the united states intense heat waves in europe recent mega floods in serbia and massive forest fires and droughts in parts of australia all clearly demonstrate that even the highly developed countries face dire and often uncontrollable threats when nature is disrupted the prospects for successfully adapting to such changes are slim the environmental shocks would likely overcome human and technological systems the argument of economic development first climate change later therefore makes no sense uncontrolled climate change would gravely threaten economic development avoiding dangerous climate change and achieving sustainable development are in summary inextricably linked managing the transition to deep decarbonization is critical to ensure that development needs are met within the constraints of profound ghg emissions reductions but avoiding dangerous climate change is equally essential to safeguard development opportunities in both rich and poor countries recent scientific evidence suggests that even a temperature increase of only c may generate very severe pervasive and irreversible risks some leading climate scientists are in fact advising to limit global warming to c instead they cite the grave long term consequences that a c increase could have on the earth society and future generations professor hansen formerly the top climate scientist at nasa points out that earth s paleoclimate history projects that a c global warming is likely to result in eventual sea level rise of six meters feet he and others also emphasize that warming of c could induce slow amplifying feedbacks for example the amazon rainforest could eventually die as a result of repeated drought releasing massive amounts of co into the atmosphere similarly methane and co buried in the permafrost in the tundra could be released into the air as the tundra melts by pushing the climate beyond the experience of the human era of the past years the world risks inducing conditions that are inhospitable for the human species and millions of others especially when humanity now comprises more than billion inhabitants on a crowded planet a c increase in global temperatures is therefore far from risk free but keeping below c of global warming is indispensable to maintain climate change within the boundaries of manageable risks and to our ability to adapt to climate change some observers argue that the c limit has become too difficult to achieve and should be weakened others go even further suggesting that the world should abandon a global emissions target altogether and instead follow a pure bottom up approach to global emissions reduction yet jettisoning or weakening the c limit would be profoundly dangerous for several important and clear reasons first as just described the burgeoning scientific evidence suggests that c is the upper limit of safety not only could a increase in temperatures by c bring untold suffering in many parts of the world from severe climate disruptions such as heat waves droughts floods and intense tropical cyclones but a rise in temperature of c or more threatens many positive feedback loops that could push the global climate system into runaway and irreversible disruptions such findings are not reported in the ipcc which limits forecasts to second loosening or dropping the internationally agreed goal of limiting the global temperature increase to c without ever having tried seriously to achieve it could spell the death of multilateral attempts to control anthropogenic climate change the global doubts about the un and the multilateral system would become profound especially after more than two decades of failed efforts to implement the unfccc there are already many influential voices that have written off the multilateral processes third there is no logical foothold or stopping point beyond c the world will not find a safe resting point say at or c loosening the c limit would very likely lead to a world without a quantified climate goal fourth without a shared climate goal the package of accompanying cooperative global actions on financing technology development and transfer capacity building and more required will also not be put in place global goals imply the means for implementing them dropping these goals will gravely undermine the will to cooperate on the implementation of climate mitigation actions yet there is little prospect of deep decarbonization for almost any nation unless there is a global cooperative framework in particular on technology demonstration and scale up there is simply no capacity for countries to achieve the necessary deep transformations required to decarbonize their economy alone fifth and perhaps most importantly many studies indicate that the c limit remains achievable at relatively modest costs globally if the right cooperative framework is put in place the global scenarios reviewed by the ipcc ar for example illustrate that there are technically feasible pathways that keep the global increase in temperature below c utilizing technologies that are already or close to being commercially available similar scenarios by the iea underscore the same point available studies show that the c limit technologically feasible and that it is also likely to be economically affordable they suggest that the global costs of reducing ghg emissions to keep the temperature increase below c are modest compared to the size of the world economy the ipcc ar for example calculates a to percentage point reduction in the annualized consumption growth rates over the period for the scenarios achieving a stabilization of ghg concentrations between and ppm which give a likely chance defined as higher than two thirds of keeping the global temperature increase below c the truth is that governments have not yet tried hard enoughor to be frank simply tried in an organized and thoughtful wayto understand and do what is necessary to keep global warming below the c limit there is in short no reason to jettison the c limit before we have really tried this report describes some of the important steps countries should follow to take the c limit seriously recognize the global carbon budget and global ghg emissions reduction trajectories to consistent with the c limit develop country level deep decarbonization pathways ddps to consistent with the c limit predicated on a shared commitment to the global goal and to all aspects of global cooperation needed to achieve it including technology cooperation financial support and policy coordination organize a massive global public private effort to develop demonstrate and diffuse various low carbon technologies that are not yet technically mature or competitive and are key to the success of deep decarbonization total co budget for the period total co budget for the period co energy budget from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes global co energy emissions reduction trajectories to fossil fuel proven reserves and resources there is a meaningful correlation between total cumulative emissions of ghgs measured in tons of co equivalent their long term concentrations and radiative forcing measured in ppm of co equivalent and watts per square meter respectively and the resulting global average temperature response measured in increase of global average temperatures the overall relation between cumulative ghg emissions and global temperature increase has been determined to be approximately linear however since there is uncertainty surrounding the relationship of cumulative ghg emissions and global temperature we must speak in terms of probability a given cumulative path of ghg emissions will offer a given probability of staying below an increase of c of mean surface temperature relative to preindustrial levels in general we are interested in global pathways that are likely to stay below c likely is usually defined as a probability of two thirds or higher the ipcc ar review of climate model scenarios has found that in order to have a likely chance of staying within the c limit the peak concentration of atmospheric ghgs would need to be in the range between and ppm of co equivalent by that in turn implies a limit on total cumulative ghg emissions over time for the purpose of the ddpp we are particularly interested in the level of cumulative co emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes permissible by mid centurywhich for simplicity we call co energysince our country research teams are developing pathways to the deep decarbonization of their energy systems to below we describe the steps and assumptions to calculate this co energy budget defining a budget for co only the largest single source of total ghg emissions at for the period requires making assumptions regarding several factors including the non co ghgs like methane no and f gases as well as contributions from climate changing factors such as aerosols and land use albedo the timing of co emission reductions and therefore the time the carbon cycle has to absorb the co emitted and the sensitivity of the climate to co and the other forcings taking into account these factors the ipcc ar working group wg found that the level of cumulative co emissions for the period should be within the range of to gt see ipcc ar working group iii mitigation of climate change chapter assessing transformation pathways table december https www ipcc ch report ar wg billion tons of co in order to achieve co concentrations consistent with a likely chance of keeping within the c limit to define a co budget for the period we need to take the century long co emissions and divide them into two time periods and the bulk of emissions will occur in the first period since net emissions should decline to zero during the second period some scenarios reviewed by the ipcc ar wg are based on the idea of net negative emissions during the second half of the century net negative emissions could be achieved for example if the use of biomass for energy production is deployed with carbon capture and sequestration ccs biomass would be burned in power plants and the power plants would in turn capture and sequester the co this is called bioenergy plus carbon capture and sequestration beccs there are other potential net negative emissions technologies including direct air capture of co to the extent that negative emissions are available on a large scale in the second half of the century the co budget for the first half of the century would be correspondingly higher but the feasibility and sustainability of large scale net negative emissions is still under debate beccs in particular raises serious issues since it combines the dual challenge of large scale biomass production and large scale storage of co at the global level the large scale use of biomass for energy production could cause deforestation and compete with land use for food production although in some countries the sustainable large scale use of biomass for energy purposes could be feasible the scale of the geological potential for co sequestration is also under debate and ccs would have to be deployed first on fossil fueled power plants and industries we have therefore made an assumption in the ddpp that large scale net negative emissions are still too uncertain to build into our country level deep decarbonization pathways ddps even though we strongly support research programs that could make net negative emissions a future reality based on the best estimates regarding non co forcings and excluding the availability of large scale net negative emissions the ipcc ar wg defines a co budget for the period of gt and of gt for the period this implies gt of co cumulative net emissions for the period the co budget of gt during combines co emissions from land use the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes defining a budget for co from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes only the focus of our country level ddps requires that we make assumptions see ipcc ar working group iii mitigation of climate change chapter assessing transformation pathways table december https www ipcc ch report ar wg see ipcc ar working group iii mitigation of climate change annex ii table a ii december https www ipcc ch report ar wg see ipcc ar working group iii mitigation of climate change annex ii table a ii december https www ipcc ch report ar wg regarding the potential for co emission reductions in the land use sector and the potential for net biological sequestration of co in particular through reforestation peat production wetland restoration and improved agricultural practices as a preliminary standard we adopted the same assumption as the ipcc ar wg of net zero emissions from land use over this century this means that the gt total co budget for the period can be considered as a budget for co energy only the budget for co energy only for the period is somewhat lower than gt since land use is assumed to reach net zero emissions only over the century not by mid century but we emphasize that there is great uncertainty regarding the precise potential and timing for co emissions reduction and net biological sequestration of co in land use and that more research is urgently needed it might prove to be impossible to achieve net zero emissions in the land use sector further reducing the size of the co energy budget alternatively it may prove to be possible to achieve net negative emissions in the land use sector in which case the permissible budget for co energy would rise accordingly we hope to be able to define a more precise co energy budget for the period in the next phases of the ddpp given all these uncertainties there are many possible global co energy emissions reduction trajectories that are consistent with a c path for the purpose of the ddpp the projected level of annual co energy emissions in is of particular interest the range of emissions in scenarios surveyed by the ipcc ar wg that give a likely chance of staying within the c limit is large it has a median value of approximately gt of co energy in particular the rcp scenario developed by pbl netherlands environmental agencywhich gives a probability higher than of staying within the c limit reaches gt of co energy in for comparison the level of co energy emissions projected in the international energy agencys iea degree scenario ds which gives a chance of staying below c of global warmingis gtco energy see the following for a description of the portfolio of related iea scenarios http www iea org publications scenariosandprojections proven reserves are defined as those fossil fuel amounts that are economically viable under current economic and technological conditions resources are defined as amounts in addition to proven reserves that are technologically accessible and potentially economically viable we also distinguish between conventional and unconventional oil and gas conventional oil and gas are deposits that can be extracted by conventional means unconventional oil deposits include shale oil heavy oil bitumen oil sands and extra heavy oil unconventional gas deposits include shale gas tight gas and coal bed methane by the end of the proven reserves amounted to trillion barrels of conventional oil trillion cubic meters of conventional natural gas and gt of coal including gt of hard coal and gt of lignite proven reserves of unconventional oil were trillion barrels and reserves of unconventional gas are estimated to be times higher than those of conventional gas taking all fossil fuels together proven reserves represent approximately gtco of potential co energy emissions aggregate fossil fuel resources are enormous representing approximately gtco of potential co energy emissions combining reserves and resources the co energy content reaches gtco see bp statistical review of world energy table co energy content of fossil fuel proven reserves and resources fossil fuel reserves resources total conventional oil gas unconventional oil gas coal total source ipcc ar wgiii chapter table the co energy budget to for the c limit is a mere gtco the amount of co contained in proven reserves is roughly times larger than the co energy budget total reserves and resources exceed the co energy budget by some times the conclusion is stark there are vastly more reserves and resources than the world can use safely this conclusion is true even allowing for a significant share of biological and geological sequestration of co even under optimistic assumptions the deployment of ccs will not enable the use of all fossil fuel resources or even reserves as a reference the iea etp ds scenario assumes ccs of around gt of co until all elements of ccs are proven at the pilot scale but the feasibility of large scale ccs deployment remains under debate since the scale of geological storage sites where carbon can be sequestered remains uncertain twelve ccs projects at stationary point sources operate around the world most of them on natural gas processing plants some of them on fertilizer production plants nine more ccs projects are under construction since ccs is a critical abatement technology in most global mitigation scenarios including in many of the ddps developed by the country research teams countries and businesses need to urgently increase the levels of rdd d in ccs to test if it can be technically and economically deployed at a large scale in the absence of ccs many countriesin particular those relying heavily of fossil fueled power generationwould find it much more difficult to achieve deep decarbonization but it is clear from the numbers reviewed above that a very large share of the fossil fuel reserves plus resources will have to stay in the ground or be strandedthat is left unused in the long term the already proven reserves are many times beyond the safe level of cumulative fossil fuel use yet the energy sector invests hundreds of billions of dollars each year to discover and develop new resources and reserves this raises the obvious question whether such investments are well directed or are simply wasteful developing reserves that can never be safely used one would instead expect the fossil fuel industries to be investing far more heavily in the rdd d of ccs in order to increase the proportion of existing reserves and resources that will eventually be usable ipcc ar wg table of the three fossil fuels coal deposits will likely be stranded in the highest proportion this is for four reasons first its reserve and resource levels are much higher than those of oil and gas and vastly greater than any plausible co energy budget second the co per unit of energy of coal is much greater than that of oil and gas and higher respectively third coal use often has very serious adverse side effects such as air pollution that causes severe disease burdens fourth most coal is used in relatively large stationary sources e g power plants where lower carbon and zero carbon substitutes are relatively easy to identify indeed given the substitutes for coal it may soon be feasible and necessary for many or most countries to stop building new coal fired power plants except for those that deploy ccs in addition to the stranding of coal deposits it is clear that the available oil and gas reserves plus resources is also large relative to the co energy budget yet which of those oil and gas reserves and resources will be stranded and which will be developed the efficient answer is to deploy the lowest cost oil and gas taking into account their respective co content per unit of energy in the cost calculations leaving the higher cost oil and gas in the ground the issue is not conventional versus non conventional resources per se it is the relative cost of the development and extraction of the alternatives we note that stranding assets will have high distributional consequences a country with stranded fossil fuel reserves may lose considerable potential income therefore the decisions on how to strand assets e g through consumption or production permits carbon taxation etc will have large distributional implications for sharing the global effort of emissions reduction that will need to be considered in any successful international framework see iea weo the drivers of co emissions the pillars of the deep decarbonization deep decarbonization requires a very significant transformation of energy systems the ultimate objective of this transformation is to phase out fossil fuel combustion with uncontrolled co emissions only fossil fuels in conjunction with ccs would remain since the co contained in proven reserves and resources of fossil fuels vastly exceeds the c global co energy budget the transformation toward a low carbon energy system cannot be driven by the scarcity of fossil fuels the simplest way to describe the deep decarbonization of energy systems is by the principal drivers of energy related co emissionsfor convenience since the focus of this chapter is on energy systems we simply refer to them as co emissions co emissions can be expressed as the product of four inputs population gdp per capita energy use per unit of gdp and co emissions per unit of energy co emissions population x gdp population x energy gdp x co energy if we take as given the population trajectory and assume a rising trajectory of gdp per capita in line with a successful economic development program then co emissions are driven mainly by two factors energy gdp and co energy the first term is the energy intensity meaning the amount of energy per unit of final output the second term is the carbon intensity of energy the energy intensity of gdp energy gdp can be reduced through energy efficiency and conservation measures in energy end use sectors passenger and goods transportation residential and commercial buildings and industry we refer to energy efficiency measures as the technical improvements of products and processes we use the term energy conservation to describe a broader set of measures including structural and behavioral changes that lead to lower levels of energy consumed per unit of gdp examples of energy efficiency and conservation measures improved vehicle for passenger and goods technologies smart urban design and optimized value chains transportation improved end use equipment architectural design building practices and construction materials in residential and commercial buildings improved equipment production processes material efficiency and re use of waste heat in industry the carbon intensity of energy co energy can be reduced in two ways first the decarbonization of electricity generation low carbon electricity through the replacement of uncontrolled fossil fuel based generation with renewable energy e g hydro wind solar and geothermal nuclear power and or fossil fuels coal gas with ccs second switching end use energy supplies fuel switching from highly carbon intensive fossil fuels in transportation buildings and industry to lower carbon fuels including include low carbon electricity other low carbon energy carriers synthesized from electricity generation or sustainable biomass or lower carbon fossil fuels in sum the deep decarbonization of energy systems rests on three pillars energy efficiency and conservation low carbon electricity fuel switching in order to deliver the required deep reductions in co emissions countries must implement all three pillars of decarbonization in a coordinated manner no single approach is sufficient given the magnitude of the deep decarbonization challenge in the global scenarios reviewed by the ipcc ar wg that give a likely chance of staying within the c limit the carbon intensity of gdp co gdp decreases by approximately compared to its level this is the result of a combined reduction in the energy intensity of gdp energy gdp and reduction in the carbon intensity of energy co energy compared to their levels the analysis of the scenarios also shows the temporal dynamics of the decarbonization of energy systems at first the reductions in the energy intensity tend to be larger than the reductions in the carbon intensity energy intensity is projected to fall by around by relative to compared with a fall in carbon intensity of approximately relative to but by mid century the decrease in the carbon intensity of energy plays a bigger role than the decrease in the energy intensity of gdp in the overall decrease of carbon intensity of gdp these dynamics are driven in part by the effects of electrification in the short run electrification only has a small effect on the co intensity of energy since electricity generation is still rather carbon intensive though as the electricity supply is decarbonized over the longer term electrification plays a big role in the decrease of the co intensity of energy the need for accelerated development of low carbon technologies key technology areas for rdd d carbon capture and sequestration energy storage and grid management advanced nuclear power vehicles and advanced biofuels industrial processes negative emissions technologies the role of technology roadmaps and roundtables lower market barriers examples deep decarbonization of the worlds energy systems requires the deployment of new low carbon technologies to transform energy production and consumption patterns this in turn will require accelerated research development demonstration and diffusion rdd d of these emission reducing technologies to make them reliable cost competitive and widely available in every country many of the technologies required for improving energy efficiency decarbonizing electricity generation and switching to low carbon fuels are already technologically mature and commercially viable they are poised to achieve much higher penetrations in the presence of policies that provide the right incentives and include renewable energy based electricity generation technologies such as hydropower wind and solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power ethanol production from biomass derived sugars and starch power and heating technologies based on hydro geothermal resources fuel efficient hybrid and battery electric light duty vehicles natural gas electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell powered buses and fleet vehicles and a wide range of energy efficient lighting heating cooling and process technologies in the building and industrial sectors but existing and commercially available technologies alone will not be sufficient in many national contexts to achieve deep decarbonization new energy supply and end use technologies will be needed requiring various levels of rdd d in order to achieve widespread uptake a number of key technology areas requiring focused attention are described below some of these technologies are still under development some have been demonstrated in pilot projects or in small commercial niches but not yet at large scale some are technically viable but at too high a cost for mass adoption some lack the complementary infrastructure needed for their deployment and some face barriers of public concern about safety reliability or environmental impacts below is a high level overview of key technology areas for low carbon rdd d based on recent literature including iea technology roadmaps the ipcc ar wg report and the global energy assessment iiasa this list of technologies is not comprehensive and represents a snapshot of a continuously evolving energy technology landscape many other new technologies are in development today that may emerge in the future rdd d efforts for decarbonization should therefore be careful not to preclude any technologies from playing a role in future decarbonization efforts the focus needs to be on reaching cost effective emissions reductions the ddps developed by the country research teams do not all rely on the same technology mix for decarbonization in particular some ddps do not use ccs while others do not use nuclear power but all achieve the objective of deep decarbonization of their national energy systems through technologies that are not yet deployed at large scale the remainder of this chapter focuses on key technological hurdles that need to be overcome through public and private rdd d in order to make deep decarbonization possible in all countries we underscore that the commercial deployment of these technologies will require a broader mix of adequate financing effective policies including putting a price on carbon emissions and direct technological support and public acceptance and support a full treatment of rdd d is beyond the scope of this interim report carbon capture and sequestration ccs commonly refers to the capture of co at large stationary point sources such as coal and natural gas fueled power plants refineries cement plants and steel mills that emit exhaust gases with a relatively high concentrations of co in some cases the co is captured after combustion through a chemical process that separates it from the other exhaust gases in other cases the co is removed from fuels through other chemical processes before combustion pre combustion and post combustion ccs technologies have a number of variants a special variant is oxyfuel combustion in which fuel is combusted in pure oxygen rather than air resulting in a relatively pure co stream after the removal of water in the exhaust stream after the co is captured at the point source it is transported by pipeline to an appropriate geological site for storage underground typically in saline aquifers more than m below the surface ccs has not yet been proven as a whole system at large scale although individual components of ccs capture transport and sequestration are established technologies ccs at small scale is already done commercially in applications where co is pumped into partially depleted oil wells for enhanced oil recovery eor in this case the injection of high pressure co generates commercial value by increasing oil production from existing wells the economics of ccs for eor therefore are not primarily driven by the carbon removal objective to date ccs projects operate around the globe at stationary point sourcesmostly at natural gas processing plants and some on fertilizer production plants at last nine more ccs projects are under air capture a non point source form of carbon capture is discussed below in the negative emissions technologies section construction two large pilot projects for ccs power generation in north america are expected to go online within the next year or two with construction and operating experience at scale the relative merits of pre combustion post combustion and oxyfuel ccs technologies for specific applications emissions requirements and economic conditions will be better understood in the long term the largest market for ccs systems will most likely be found in the electric power sector where coal burning plants constitute the greatest and most concentrated point source of co the main challenges of ccs reside in scale cost and verification the sheer volume of co under consideration is large for every ton of coal entering a ccs equipped power plant about three tons of co must be captured and stored open questions include the optimal power plant design to facilitate carbon capture the design of an effective reliable and economical infrastructure to transport co the choice of geological sites for storage at the scale of tens or hundreds of billions of tons of co over coming decades and the mechanisms for assuring that stored co in fact remains out of the atmosphere recent sharp declines in the cost of solar photovoltaic modules and more gradual declines in price of wind turbines have reduced the direct costs of electricity from time varying renewable energy resources to levels comparable to that from other fuels in many countries the cost of solar and wind energy per se is therefore no longer a substantial impediment the main challenge remains the intermittency of these energy sources and therefore their inability to provide reliable power on a desired schedule power grids must be able to match energy demand and energy supply on a moment by moment basis in order to maintain grid functionality and stability this is traditionally accomplished with large generators such as coal fired and nuclear power plants that provide shock absorption and built in energy storage by way of their fuel reservoir and massive rotational inertia these stable base load generators are complemented by flexible and readily dispatchable units such as gas turbines to make for a supply system capable of following demand at will as the penetration level of intermittent and non dispatchable renewable resources increases the electric grid must rely on other low carbon methods of balancing supply and demand likely requiring a more refined coordination of diverse resources in space and time three principal approaches are available to balance an electric power system with a high penetration of time varying renewable resources first to compensate for the intermittency with other generation second to coordinate and control electric demand so as to coincide with power availability known as demand response and flexible load and third energy storage examples of the first approach include grid networks that link uncorrelated or negatively correlated supplies of intermittent energy as well as hybrid systems that combine wind and solar energy with gas powered electricity generation however gas hybrid systems are limited in how much natural gas can be used while meeting the falling target emissions intensity of the grid demand response and flexible load offer a large potential resource for adjusting the temporal profile of loads often taking advantage of thermal energy storage at the end use location the main challenges of both of these approaches are in the realm of information management communication control and economic incentives the costs of sensor and communication technologies have declined dramatically so that the potential for decentralized automatic demand response capability in millions of individual devices is now available also the emergence of electric vehicles with flexible charging capability suggests that an increasing capacity for demand response is becoming available storing excess energy for delivery during periods of lower supply is the most obvious approach to matching electric demand and supply since it fits readily into the traditional design philosophy of the grid although it is not necessarily the least costly a variety of electric storage technologies are known and have been demonstrated on a broad range of time scales from seasonal to daily hourly and second by second storage short term storage may also be used for improving electric power quality and local reliability large scale pumped hydroelectric storage has been cost effective in many countries for decades where it is availablefor example norways mountain reservoirs that store denmarks wind power the intermittency problem can be solved however topography water availability and environmental concerns greatly limit the feasible locations for pumped hydro storage many other storage technologies exist including batteries flywheels compressed air molten salts hydrogen through hydrolysis and synthetic hydrocarbons e g using captured co plus renewable energy to create liquid hydrocarbons substantial development and demonstration is required to determine the best matches between diverse storage technologies and cost effective applications and to commercialize these technologies at a large scale there are presently countries with nuclear energy some of these are proposing to phase out their nuclear power fleet others plan to scale back and still others are planning to expand their nuclear capacity dramatically yet high costs safety considerations proliferation concerns issues of waste management and public resistance especially following the fukushima accident currently hinder a decisive scale up of nuclear energy public support for nuclear technology may have important non technical dimensionsfor example philosophical differences over appropriate strategies for nuclear waste disposal as well as symbolic links between nuclear energy and weaponsthat are not readily addressed by engineering improvements technical advances however also play a critical role breakthroughs in safety systems reliability fuel security fuel recycling and dependably low costs will likely be needed in order for nuclear energy to remain a significant part of the decarbonization pathways of major emitting economies the term fourth generation nuclear power generally refers to a range of nuclear fission energy technology advances that involve the modularity of production systems smaller scale units alternative systems for fuel reprocessing alternative e g thorium fuels as well as improved automatic and passive safety systems design goals include greater simplicity so that reactors are less vulnerable to construction delays and cost overruns safe operability of reactors as dispatchable load following units and proliferation resistance i e making it much more difficult to divert materials from any point in the fuel cycle for nuclear weapons passive reactor safety is another key feature meaning that the reactor core is assured by physical first principles to be safe from meltdown even in the absence of active cooling e g cooling based on water pumping that itself requires electric power the decarbonization of the transport fleet beginning with personal vehicles but also extending to heavy duty vehicles aviation and ocean shipping is crucial to stay within c a range of cutting edge technologies such as high performance batteries hydrogen fuel cells and advanced biofuels hold the potential to decarbonize much or all the transport sector yet most low carbon transport technologies are pre commercial at least at a large scale for electric vehicles lithium ion liion batteries are expected to improve incrementally but new battery technologies will likely be required to achieve higher energy and power densities lengthen vehicle range and lower up front vehicle costs biofuels especially liquid biofuels offer the prospect of decarbonization with the continued use of existing infrastructure and technologies including internal combustion engines oil pipelines and gas station pumps yet biofuels have a clear downside many existing biofuels e g maize based ethanol in the united states compete with other critical land uses such as food and feed production and ecosystem needs like land and water utilization advanced biofuels aim to overcome the competition between biofuels food and ecosystems possible technologies for such advanced biofuels include bioengineered organisms e g algae bacteria to produce biofuels and the processing of non foodstuffs from non arable land into biofuels e g cellulosic biofuels produced from wood products efforts to produce fuels directly from sunlight water and carbon dioxide without using biological organisms artificial photosynthesis are still at an early research stage and focus primarily on producing hydrogen success here could greatly decrease the land area required to produce a unit of fuel as compared to biomass but important challenges such as competing land uses limited water resources and sustainable sources of carbon for fuel synthesis will still need to be overcome process heat in industry is one of the most challenging sources of energy co emission to decarbonize many industrial processes such as smelting cement production steelmaking oil refining and other distillation processes require vast inputs of heat typically with very large co emissions in principle many of these heat processes could be electrified or the heat could be produced with zero emission fuel cells e g hydrogen based cells electrical energy can provide increased efficiency through the appropriate use of directed heating technologies e g electric arc magnetic induction microwave ultraviolet radio frequency given the diversity of these processes and the varying contexts in which they are used scale and organization of the industrial processes it is highly uncertain whether industrial processes can be decarbonized using available technologies much greater efforts of rdd d are therefore required in this under studied area to ensure deep decarbonization by mid century many low carbon scenarios including some in ipcc ar project an overshooting of the carbon budget in the first half of the st century which must then be offset through net negative emissions in the second half of the century the popular placeholder for net negative emissions is the integration of biomass energy be with ccs both as technologies for electricity generation and biofuel production beccs combines the dual challenge of large scale biomass production and large scale storage of co the feasibility of each component of beccs is uncertain and their combination is therefore even less certain at this stage an alternative approach for net negative emissions would be the direct air capture of co followed by geological storage air capture refers to technologies that extract co from the atmosphere at the ambient concentration of co i e ppm the advantage of direct air capture is that it can be done anywhere without the need for transport of the co to a storage site a disadvantage is that the process of isolating and removing the co from air at low ambient concentrations is technically challenging currently expensive and unproven at scale roadmaps have been used successfully there are strong reasons to believe that the necessary technologies for deep decarbonization are within reach from an engineering and cost standpoint but their commercial readiness needs to be accelerated by providing appropriate policy support and by building public private partnerships on rdd d effective global strategies for deep decarbonization must include strategies for promoting the development and diffusion of low carbon technologies previous examples of successful technology rdd d share a number of characteristics clear goals and timelines for technology performance were set public and private actors organized around long term technology roadmaps industry both competed and cooperated to identify promising lines of inquiry and demonstration grants were issued on a highly competitive basis and intellectual property was frequently shared or open source key rdd d mechanisms include technology roadmaps and technology roundtables they complement market based instruments for low carbon transition such as carbon taxation emissions permit systems and regulations technology including semiconductors and genetics to identify priorities for research and technology development such roadmaps help mobilize and organize the public and private players in expert communities around shared priorities and ensure effective use of scarce resources for rdd d they will be a key tool in driving directed technological innovation for low carbon technologies the scope and content of these technology roadmaps should be frequently updated to make sure the necessary rdd d push does not preclude any technology that could play a role in the achievement of cost effective emissions reduction in every sector multi stakeholder technology roundtables can develop these technology roadmaps such roundtables should gather governments businesses investors and other critical stakeholders with an interest in a particular technology the roundtables would prepare and update technology roadmaps identify priority areas for public and private rdd d and mobilize public and private funds for rdd d as one example the iea has been operating technology roundtables for key energy technologies in many technology areas the objective of developing country level ddps backcasting approach consistent with the c target not a burden sharing approach level of per capita emissions by as a benchmark not as a target sectoral performance indicators as benchmarks not as targets bottom up approach with transparent technological assumptions summary of general assumptions the deep decarbonization pathways project ddpp is a collaborative initiative to understand and show how countries can transition to a low carbon economy and how the world can meet the internationally agreed objective of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature to less than c currently the ddpp comprises country research teams composed of leading researchers and research institutions from some of the worlds top emitting countries representing more than of global ghg emissions and at different stages of development australia brazil canada china france germany india indonesia japan mexico russia south africa south korea the uk and the usa each ddpp country research team develops a pathway for deep decarbonization with the intent of taking into account their countrys socio economic conditions development aspirations infrastructure stocks natural resources endowments and other relevant factors the ddps developed by the country research teams presented in this report are intended to provide a complementary analysis to existing global level studies of deep emissions reductions prior to the ddpp only a few countries had studied pathways with emissions reductions large enough by to be consistent with the objective of staying within the c limit global studies including those by ipcc and iea have offered a framework for analyzing of deep decarbonization at a high level and have identified total worldwide emission reduction trajectories that would be consistent with particular temperature change limits including c global studies also highlight common actions and technological challenges associated with deep decarbonization across many regions on their own however global studies can be insufficient to make a clear and convincing case for action at the country level at times the assumptions underlying global studies may be inconsistent with individual countries socio economic development objectives and may lack enough granularity on individual countrys economic sectors and existing infrastructure to present a technical roadmap for policy implementation at the country level this interim report of the ddpp focuses on an initial analysis of the technical feasibility of ddps within each country the ddpp report will refine the analysis of the technical decarbonization potential exploring options for even deeper decarbonization and also better taking into account existing infrastructure stocks at this stage will have not yet looked in detail at the issue of the costs and benefits of mitigation actions nor considered the question of who should pay for them the ddpp report will also take a broader perspective and go beyond technical feasibility to analyze in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches and implementation this chapter describes the methodology adopted by the consortium of country research teams of the ddpp for the technical feasibility stage of the analysis identify policy frameworks for the term backcasting is used to denote a process in which a target is fixed for a future date and then a pathway towards achieving the target is identified by moving backward in time our project falls squarely within the backcasting framework we have taken the c limit in global temperature increase as the target translated this target into a global co energy budget for the period a per capita emissions benchmark and sectoral performance indicators benchmarks and the country research teams explored pathways to that would be line with both the global target and their own national circumstances we have not allocated the cumulative co energy global budget across countries but rather have used it as a benchmark for exploring ddps in past international climate negotiations government officials have struggled to reconcile different views on how to fairly divide a certain global carbon budget or ghg emissions reduction target into national carbon budgets these disagreements include whether or how to take into account historic emissions the potential options and cost for mitigation and the basis for ghg accounting rules such disagreements over the equitable sharing of global mitigation efforts have been a stumbling block for many years in unfccc negotiations leading to insufficient international action to date the ddpp has sought to de emphasize the contentious question on precise allocation of individual budgets or targets and instead to focus on common bold actions that will be eventually needed within nearly all countries the plain fact is that regardless of the precise allocation rules on ghg emissions to stay within the c limit every major emitting country will have to undertake a deep transformation of their energy systems to low carbon energy by to guide the exploration of their ddps the country research teams used a global average per capita emissions level as a benchmark but not as a target in a strict sense for the purposes of developing the ddpp benchmark we have chosen the iea ds scenario as our reference scenario globally the cumulative emissions trajectory from the iea ds results in a chance of staying within the c limit and the ds scenario reaches gt of co energy by this level translates to a benchmark of tons of co energy emissions per capita by assuming a global population of billion by in line with the medium fertility projection of the un population division the reason for this choice was not to constrain the analysis within a chance of staying within the c limit in fact during the next phase the country research teams will explore further options for deep decarbonization and they could lead to a higher than chance of staying within the c limit but the iea is a key ddpp partner organization and has shared the global assumptions and country results of the ds with the country research teams to assist them in the development of their own ddps the reason why the convergence of per capita emissions by cannot be used as a single criterion for the equitable allocation of the global carbon budget across countries is that it fails to capture important differences across countries related either to their technical potential for decarbonization capabilities to implement mitigation actions existing economic structure and energy infrastructure or historical and cumulative emissions while recognizing these important limitations it provides a useful benchmark to guide the exploration of country level ddps indeed very few countries with co energy per capita above tons today will be able to go far below this level by on the other hand catch up economic growth in low income countries that currently emit less than tco per capita will increase their per capita emissions by even as they decrease the carbon intensity of their economic growth as a consequence if very few countries can go below tons of co energy emissions per capita by and very few countries can be significantly above then all countries should converge close to the global average in addition to the level of per capita emissions by the country research teams have also used sectoral performance indicators to guide the exploration of their ddps compared to per capita emissions sectoral performance indicators are a better way to account for countries structural differences for example by using this indicator a country could have higher emissions per capita than the world average not as a result of lower efforts to decarbonize its industry but as a consequence of a higher share of industry in its gdp than the world average we have used the scenarios reviewed by the ipcc ar wg to define sectoral performance indicators for power generation buildings transport and industry consistent with the c limit as the convergence of per capita emissions sectoral performance indicators have important limitations and do not account for possible limitations in the technical mitigation potential different capacities to implement these actions or historical and cumulative emissions but we have used them to ensure that their sectoral strategies in the ddps developed by the country research teams were thoroughly evaluated table range and median value of sectoral performance indicators in the ipcc c scenarios sector sub sector region indicator power generation buildings

of industrial production paper tco ton industrial product benchmark in benchmark in median value range a key element of the ddpp approach was to define a common set of shared assumptions across countries in particular those regarding the availability of technologies that are not yet commercially available as discussed in detail in chapter iv achieving deep decarbonization indeed rests on the accelerated deployment at scale of technologies that are not yet commercially available or not currently competitive with conventional technologies achieving full commercialization of these technologies is often beyond the reach of any individual country or company the ddps developed by the country research teams assume that the world invests massively through public and private partnerships in the development and early deployment of these technologies only these assumptions made it possible for country research teams to project that the technologies they needed to achieve deep decarbonization would be available to them table shared technological assumptions in the ddpp for when improved low carbon technologies will become available for deployment at scale sector technology starting date of deployment at scale power transport industry ccs coal and gas advanced geothermal advanced energy storage iv gen nuclear global availability of long range evs across all vehicle types second generation biofuels hydrogen fuel cells ccs in industry close to pure co streams electric boilers and process heaters the depth and breadth of technology deployment strongly depends on country specific circumstances including the availability of alternative technological options the infrastructure to support the deployment of technologies and public acceptance and support all of these technologies did not have to be deployed by the dates listed in each and every ddp but country research teams had the option to utilize the technologies if their country has the physical potential e g geological potential for carbon storage and if the technologies were necessary and cost effective to achieve the objective of deep decarbonization moreover we emphasize that the ddpp is still at an interim stage in considering the full range of technology options there is continued debate around certain technologies such as the future of ccs fourth generation nuclear power and advanced biofuels both among the country research teams and more generally we will therefore base the report on a more detailed and considered assessment of the timing scalability and financing of the various low carbon technology options to summarize the national deep decarbonization pathways produced by the ddpp country research teams are based on a number of assumptions and enabling conditions all countries take strong early and coordinated actions to combat climate change all countries operate in a supportive global policy environment that is firmly directed at the c limit there is ample public private partnership and cooperation to enable the rapid development demonstration and diffusion of the requisite low carbon technologies in all key sectors open global markets ensure the global diffusion of low carbon technologies and their cost reduction through scale and learning effects major global cooperative efforts speed technology development and improve the reach and performance of low carbon technologies ranging from renewables to nuclear power to ccs to energy efficiency financial flows are re directed from high carbon to low carbon portfolios and projects financial support is provided implicitly to countries with lower capacities to implement mitigation policies and finance low carbon investments though such support is not modeled in this phase of the project low carbon technologies become available and affordable to all countries for example through a technology cooperation mechanism and fund previous studies have frequently assumed the use of large quantities of offsets to minimize costs the implicit assumption is that large emitters could fund emissions reductions in low emitting countries in exchange for reducing the need for local reductions as noted previously this assumption becomes unlikely under global deep decarbonization scenario in line with c limit as all countries will have to make real efforts to come close to the tons per capita global average or sectoral performance indicator benchmarks for this reason we did not explore global offsets in the national scenarios we assume that the volume of such offsets will at best be relatively small introduction deep decarbonization in the context of sustainable development economic growth assumptions energy demand aggregate results examining the pillars of deep decarbonization at country level sectoral strategies sectoral shares of total emissions power generation switch to low carbon electricity residential buildings passenger transport freight transport industry areas for further analysis all results presented in this chapter are drawn directly from the ddps developed by the country research teams these results are preliminary they represent an initial analysis of the technical feasibility of ddps within each country no definitive judgments based on the details of the country ddps or their aggregate results should therefore be drawn at this stage the focus in the country analyses was on achieving deep reductions in co emissions in these preliminary analyses will be revised in the coming months to explore the options for even deeper decarbonization pathways better take into account the existing infrastructure stocks and focuse more on co emissions trajectories and cumulative co emissions from the full costs of the ddps developed by the country research teams have not yet been examined in detail but the ddps are based on socio economic assumptions which reflect each country research teams vision of its national development trajectory to all ddps assume continuedand for some countries rapideconomic growth to assumed gdp growth rates are especially strong in todays middle income economies which start from lower levels of gdp per capita than high income countries today and therefore have room for catch up growth figure as a result of sustained economic growth all ddps anticipate higher levels of gdp per capita in than south korea today across the ddps average energy consumption per capita converges to two metric tons of oil equivalent toe by figure it declines in absolute terms in high income countries where energy efficiency improvements outweigh population and gdp growth in middle income countries on the other hand energy consumption increases in absolute terms as a result of improved energy access and rapid gdp growth in part driven by energy intensive industries however this increase is lower than it would otherwise be because of improvements in energy efficiency all ddps achieve very significant reductions in coenergy emissions by in aggregate co energy emissions from the ddps fall to gt by which is a reduction from the gt that these countries emitted in figure this decline in coenergy emissions is even more significant when accounting for continued population and gdp growth over the period across the ddps population and gdp in us are expected to grow by and respectively from in aggregate the ddps thus achieve a decrease in per capita coenergy emissions from tcoenergy to tcoenergy per capita and a decline in the coenergy intensity of gdp from to tco per gdp by mid century figures and this corresponds to an average annual decrease of emissions per capita and a annual decrease of emissions per unit of gdp over in aggregate the ddps also represent a very significant departure from current trends between and average per capita coenergy emissions increased by per year and coenergy intensity of gdp decreased by only per year in the aggregate ddp trends in total and per capita emissions are reversed and the declining trend in coenergy intensity of gdp is accelerated the aggregate ddp also marks a very significant departure from projected trends under business as usual bau trajectories or weak climate policy scenarios the ddpp country research teams did not produce bau scenarios of their own as the focus instead was on ddps for an illustrative comparison we look to the iea energy technology perspectives etp scenarios which are available for of the countries covered by the ddpp brazil china india mexico russia south africa and the u s these countries represent of the total emissions from our countries in and of total projected emissions in which makes the comparison meaningful the iea c scenario ds is largely an extension of current trends in the absence of efforts to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of ghgs average global temperature is projected to rise at least c in the long term the c scenario ds takes into account recent pledges made by countries to limit emissions and step up efforts to improve energy efficiency it serves as the primary benchmark in etp when comparisons are made among scenarios and it projects a long term temperature rise of c the c scenario ds is the main focus of etp it describes an energy system consistent with an emissions trajectory that recent climate science research indicates would give at least a chance of limiting average global temperature increase to c our seven country ddps achieve a roughly reduction in coenergy emissions relative to an extension of current trends ds a more than halving of emissions relative to recently promised mitigation efforts ds and are close to but slightly higher than the ds figure note the comparison only includes the ddps for brazil china india mexico russia south africa and the usa to match the countries analyzed as part of the iea scenarios it is still too early for the ddpp to compare the cumulative emissions from our ddps with the global coenergy budget for to have a likely chance of staying within the c limit as already emphasized the primary focus of the analysis at this stage was reaching the lowest possible level of emissions in driven by our per capita emissions and sectoral performance indicators benchmarks not the lowest possible level of cumulative emissions to under reasonable assumptions for the rest of the world the level of emissions of our ddps is still too high to give a chance of keeping below c as the comparison with the iea ds scenario for a subset of of our countries also shows our ddps have higher emissions during the period not only by as a consequence the cumulative emissions from our ddps is also certainly higher than the global co energy budget for to have a chance of staying within the c limit but this should not be interpreted as proving that strong early mitigation actions such as those in the iea ds are impossible it is only a consequence of the methodology adopted at this stage focusing on the level of emissions given the purpose of the analysis at this stage we are encouraged by the initial results which show that the decarbonization achieved by is already very substantial and well on its way to becoming consistent with the c limit in the coming months ddpp country research teams will explore options for even deeper decarbonization pathways and will pay more attention to the management of the transition to with the objective of lowering cumulative emissions the interim ddps developed by the country research teams help to illuminate key elements of deep decarbonization strategies across countries the main options in different countries and the most important challenges moving forward the rest of the chapter presents and discusses these preliminary findings all ddps share three common pillars for the deep decarbonization of their national energy systems energy efficiency low carbon electricity and switching to low carbon fuels all ddps achieve a large decrease in co intensity of gdp tco emitted per gdp by compared to on average this is the result of the combined effects of a decrease in the final energy intensity of gdp toe consumed per gdp and a decrease in the co intensity of energy tco emitted per toe of final energy consumed on average the energy intensity of gdp decreases by between and and the co intensity of energy decreases by the relative importance of these two elements in the ddps changes over time figure reducing energy intensity of gdp is more important in the early phase while reductions in the co intensity of final energy consumption play a larger role in the long term the dynamics in figure are driven in part by the effects of electrification all country research teams use decarbonization of electricity supply and electrification of energy end uses as a strategy for deep decarbonization to different extents in the short run electrification only has a small effect on the co intensity of energy since electricity generation is still rather carbon intensive though electrification plays a big role in the decrease of the co intensity of energy over the longer term as electricity supply is decarbonized these kinds of sequencing challenges and their implications for cumulative co emissions will be further explored in the next phases of the ddpp across the ddps different sectors contribute to different levels of co emission reductions figure the power sector achieves the largest reduction in emissions with an reduction in emissions gt co by gt co its share in total emissions falls from to direct co emissions from the residential building and passenger transport sectors also fall in absolute the decrease of the final energy intensity of gdp combines technical efficiency and structural economic change towards less energy intensive activities terms by and respectively but their share in total emissions decreases only slightly from to and to respectively co emissions from freight transport and industry appear to be relatively more difficult to reduce emissions from freight transport increase slightly by while industry emissions decrease only by as a consequence the share of freight and industry in total emissions increases significantly by from to and to respectively this demonstrates the importance of finding additional and innovative ways to reduce emissions in these two sectors electrification and the decarbonization of electricity plays a central role in all ddps electricity has a much larger role in energy supplies the share of electricity in final energy consumption almost doubles from rising from to power generation is almost completely decarbonized in all countries on average the co intensity of power production is reduced by from gco per kilowatt hour kwh in to gco per kwh by figure to reach such a low level of carbon intensity power needs to be generated almost exclusively from zero or low carbon sources in all countries renewable energy nuclear power or fossil fuels with ccs across countries the ddps achieve the deep decarbonization of power generation through a diverse mix of low carbon energy sources because countries have different potential for renewable energy geological storage capacity for ccs and social preferences and degrees of public support for nuclear power and ccs figure but by almost all electricity in all ddps is generated from zero and low carbon sources figure measuring aggregate improvements in the energy efficiency of residential buildings is difficult because of the many uses of energy in buildings such as heating cooling cooking and appliances the relative importance of these energy uses varies both between and within countries in part due to differences in climatic conditions energy efficiency indicators e g energy use per square meter or per capita are thus imperfect for cross country comparison and are not reported here for the co intensity of residential energy use all ddps show a significant decrease figure driven primarily by increased electrification of residential energy in most countries figure and increased use of solar thermal energy and combined heat and power chp in others among the ddps most high income countries see a modest reduction canada france u s or a small increase australia japan korea uk in passenger mobility passenger kilometers traveled per capita between and figure russia the only high income country with low levels of passenger mobility sees a large increase in mobility that brings it more in line with other high income countries some middle income countries e g china india see a sharp increase in passenger mobility converging to levels that match or are close to todays high income countries in other middle income countries e g indonesia mexico south africa increases in passenger mobility are more moderate all ddps achieve a sharp decrease in the energy intensity of passenger transport toe per passenger kilometers traveled figure combined with a decrease in the co intensity of energy used for passenger transport tco per toe of final energy consumed figure the electrification of passenger vehicles plays an important role in decarbonizing the energy used in passenger transport but country research teams use other decarbonization strategies as well including biofuels and fuel cell vehicles powered by renewable hydrogen all ddps except one decouple freight mobility freight ton kilometers from gdp growth figure however total co emissions from freight transport increase because reductions in the energy intensity of freight transport toe per ton kilometer traveled and the co intensity of freight transport energy tco emitted per toe are relatively small figures and the ddps illustrate that in general freight transport is more difficult to decarbonize than passenger transport although there are several options for reducing the co intensity of freight transport electrification compressed or liquefied low carbon gas modal shifts and sustainable biofuelsthey all face challenges in deploying at the scale needed to achieve significant co reductions the results from these preliminary ddps underscore the importance of a strong global r d push on technologies and strategies to reduce co emissions in freight transport beyond technology the sector should also explore ways to organize freight transport differently through modal shifts and to reduce the need for freight transport through optimized production consumption and transportation patterns as with residential buildings measuring aggregate energy efficiency in industry is difficult because of the diversity of sub sectors within industry national comparisons are difficult because of differences in industrial sector composition between countries and the complex nature of the modern global trading system nevertheless there are similarities in decarbonization strategies across countries all ddps include aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption in industry using three main strategieselectrification fuel switching and ccs most ddps achieve large reductions in the co intensity of energy used in industry figure electricitys share of industrial final energy consumption increases significantly across all countries figure even with reductions in energy co intensity in industry aggregate industrial emissions in the ddps rise over time by industrial emissions account for of total emissions up from in these results suggest the importance of developing innovative technology pathways for reducing co emissions from key industrial sectors i e tco per ton output as well as the less materials intensive production methods i e requiring fewer tons of materials and less carbon intensive production materials the ddpp results thus far while preliminary illustrate both the technical possibilities and the challenges for deep decarbonization across a wide range of national contexts as a next step and before we quantify the costs and benefits of decarbonization identify national and international finance requirements analyze in more detail how the twin objectives of development and deep decarbonization can be met through integrated approaches and map out the policy frameworks for implementation the ddpp country research teams will explore four areas that were not included in the first round of analysis of the technically feasibility first the country research teams will explore a greater array of technology options including some that are still at the pre commercial stage so far they have incorporated emerging technologies and energy system configurations to different extents in their analyses and there is likely still potential to further reduce co emissions per unit of activity e g co per passenger kilometer traveled in the ddps although the feasibility of technology deployment at the national level will have to be examined carefully second teams will further explore energy drivers in their models through scenario analysis most of the ddps are based on conservative assumptions about activity drivers and reducing the level of these drivers will reduce co emissions e g reductions in passenger kilometers traveled will reduce co emissions from passenger transport third teams will consider in further details the issue of infrastructure stocks fourth teams will estimate cumulative co emissions from rather than focusing only on a single year an important outcome of the ddpp so far is that it has fostered interactive learning and a cooperative problem solving mindset among technical and macroeconomic assumptions sectoral expertise and data sources the backcasting approach which was new to many of the country research teams created a framework for innovative thinking and produced creative results over the eight months since the project began including several face to face meetings this process has led to the development of much more ambitious ddps than found in many previous studies of national mitigation potential this interim report is only a start but it is our hope that this report as well as the more comprehensive report to be published during the first half of will make a useful contribution to the debate by spurring the development and international comparison of country level ddps and by promoting the global cooperation required to achieve them the participants teams have shared their australia canada china france indonesia japan mexico russia south africa south korea united kingdom united states this interim ddpp report includes country chapters the remaining three chapters brazil germany and india will be made available online at deepdecarbonization org in the coming weeks the full set of country chapters will be included in the full ddpp report to be published in september australia is a mid sized developed economy with high per capita greenhouse gas emissions exports of energy minerals and agricultural commodities have always played an important role in the australian economy with the relative importance of specific commodities changing over the decades in response to international demand australia has abundant renewable and non renewable energy resources and relatively easily recoverable reserves of coal gas and uranium australia is one of the leading exporters of coal and domestic coal production is forecast to continue to increase with a number of liquefaction projects under construction the country is also set to soon become the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas lng in addition australia is a major supplier of minerals such as bauxite alumina iron ore uranium copper and lithium australias abundant renewable energy resources and significant sequestration potential through carbon plantings could be harnessed under decarbonization australias economy is highly emissions intensive due to the extensive use of coal in electricity supply electricity accounts for two thirds of australias greenhouse gas emissions with coal fired power accounting for of generation and gas providing a further the remainder is mostly supplied by renewable energy technologies including hydroelectricity wind bioenergy and solar photovoltaic pv australia exports uranium but does not generate any electricity from nuclear power bree australia is the worlds largest exporter of metallurgical coal and the second largest thermal coal exporter by volume bree seven new liquefied natural gas liquefaction facilities are expected to enter the export market by bree a oil and other sources including multi fuel fired power plants contribute on average solar pv and wind have grown and over the past five years respectively the data is for service industries including education tourism and finance are important in australias economy contributing more than half of australias gdp the competitiveness of exports from these sectors is strongly influenced by exchange rates and these industries are likely to expand over the medium term global deep decarbonization would significantly change demand for australian exports while domestic decarbonization would require fundamental changes in australias energy system over the coming decades these changes would present both challenges and opportunities for australia both within the energy sector and more widely australias per capita emissions are among the highest in the world this is due to the predominance of coal fired generation in australias electricity supply the relatively large contribution of energy and emissions intensive industrial activity to the australian economy the historically low cost of energy the economic importance of agriculture and the long distance transport requirements resulting from the concentration of australias population in urban centers and large distances between the urban centers figure a shows australias greenhouse gas emissions by source and figure b shows the decomposition of energy related co emissions i e from fossil fuel combustion source bree b department of the environment data variations are due to rounding error australias economic circumstances are somewhat unique in the global context insofar as emissions from mining and manufacturing contribute a relatively large share over one third of australias total greenhouse gas emissions of which about one third are process and fugitive emissions in addition about of australias total emissions are attributable to agriculture including methane emissions from livestock figure shows the proportional contribution of industry sectors to australias total greenhouse gas emissions gdp and export revenues source abs department of the environment however australia has made some recent progress in decarbonizing its economy over the past two decades australias greenhouse gas emissions have remained stable while the size of the economy has almost doubled as a result the emissions intensity of australias gdp has nearly halved and emissions per capita have decreased by approximately over this period see figure f increasing emissions from energy use were roughly offset by reduced deforestation and increased plantation forestry since emissions from fuel combustion have stabilized driven by a significant expansion in renewable energy a drop in demand for grid supplied electricity and a tripling in the rate of energy efficiency improvement in large industrial companies rising energy prices and government programs and policies including standards and subsidies for energy efficiency carbon pricing and support programs for renewable energy have helped achieve this outcome source abs bree b department of the environment note figure a and b for international comparison australia has a broad range of options for decarbonizing its economy and multiple possible pathways could be modelled however the analysis in this report describes and presents results for one illustrative pathway in line with the global project parameters and methodology the modelling for the illustrative pathway prioritizes continued economic growth and focuses on technological solutions with less emphasis on change in economic structure or consumption patterns beyond current projections assumptions about the availability and cost of technologies are deliberately conservative in the context of a decarbonizing world potential step changes in technology and economic structure are not included in the example pathway but are being explored qualitatively the possibility that some technologies included in the example pathway are not available or end up being more costly than assumed in the modelling has been explored in section the analysis builds on previous australian work including commonwealth science and industrial research organisation csiro power land and transport sector modelling it has also been informed by the feedback gathered via consultation with over industry and academic experts which identified that stakeholder views diverge on the viability likely extent and costs of options such as carbon capture and storage ccs carbon forestry and bioenergy australia can maintain economic growth and prosperity and decarbonize by the results from the illustrative pathway show that between now and real gdp grows at per year on average resulting in an economy nearly larger than today productivity keeps rising with growth in real wages and exports growing at per annum table summarizes the economic and population growth trajectory however economic growth is not uniform across the economy growth driven by the increase in activities such as renewable energy generation and forestry is offset by significant reductions in primary industries such as coal production oil extraction and heavy manufacturing this is discussed in section under the industry heading table development indicators and energy service demand drivers population millions gdp per capita a capita in australias energy related emissions were approximately tco per capita and for australia to contribute to the objective of limiting global temperature to c this would need to decrease by an order of magnitude by in the illustrative pathway australias energy related emissions are substantially reduced to tco per capita in and are lower still at tco per capita if emissions directly attributable to the production of exports are excluded within the modelling parameters of the illustrative pathway including the forecast growth in global demand for energy and mineral commodities deeper decarbonization of australias energy related emissions would likely require technological advances that increase the viability and or reduce the cost of decarbonization options graham et al reedman graham iea australias total primary energy use decreases by from to while final energy use increases by see figure a and b there are significant changes in the fuel mix coal use is almost entirely phased out the only remaining use is for coking coal in iron and steel and there is an increase in renewables and biomass and gas use australias energy related co emissions pathway from to is shown in figure a to c note for international comparison decarbonization of energy transformation mainly electricity generation combined with electrification supplied by decarbonized electricity and fuel switching leads to nearly a reduction in the emissions intensity of energy use across all economic sectors the contribution of these pillars is shown in figure b while a description is provided below structural change the illustrative pathway only assumes changes in economic and or industrial structures that occur in response to domestic and global macroeconomic trends these include global demand for commodities existing and emerging trends in consumer preferences continued growth of the service sector and a plateauing of distance travelled per capita in cars and other modes of transport in combination these changes lead to a halving of final energy use per dollar of real gdp by energy efficiency energy efficiency is assumed to continue to improve at current rates until but accelerates thereafter especially in the building and transport sectors electrification and fuel switching electrification becomes widespread especially for cars buildings and industrial processes such as heating processes or material handling thermal coal use in industry is considerably reduced via a shift to gas and biomass wherever possible freight fuels move away from diesel with a significant shift to gas decarbonization of energy transformation electricity generation is almost completely decarbonized via renewable grid integrated supply of electricity with some on site gas fired electricity generation particularly in remote non grid integrated areas other mixes of technologies for electricity generation are modelled as variants refer to section there is significant replacement of direct fossil fuel use with bioenergy note for international comparison the illustrative pathway includes considerable reductions in non energy emissions including industrial process and fugitive emissions the modelling assumes that best practice is applied in farming and livestock production and that global beef demand decreases slightly in response to increases in price due to its relatively high emissions intensity and land constraints australia has substantial potential to offset emissions via land sector sequestration the illustrative pathway includes a shift in land use toward carbon forestry driven by carbon abatement incentives where profitable for land holders but it does not include the sale of emissions offsets into overseas markets figure shows the underlying drivers of decarbonization figure b and the pathway of decarbonization figure a for all emissions sources and sinks after accounting for all emissions sources and sinks the pathway includes intermediate emissions reductions milestones of below levels in at least below levels in and to net zero emissions by the cumulative emissions to are compatible with australias carbon budget recommended by australias climate change authority an independent body established under the climate change act this would require strong mitigation action in all sectors of the economy in the context of a strong global decarbonization effort the trajectory of decarbonization pathways varies substantially among sectors depending on the availability and relative cost of technologies required in each sector in industry is the largest contributor to energy emissions due to continued high levels of activity in mining and manufacturing followed by transport see figures and nearly half of australias energy emissions in are directly attributable to exports mostly for production of industrial commodities see figure by fuel combustion emissions reduce by about compared to the main contributor to australias non energy emissions in is agriculture as currently there are limited options for reducing emissions from the agricultural sector sequestration via carbon forestry of approximately tcoe per person is required for australia to achieve zero net emissions see figure electrification across all sectors drives a two and one half fold increase in electricity demand by however the substantial change in australias electricity generation mix leads to a greater than reduction in the emissions intensity of electricity to tco mwh in of electricity demand is met by grid integrated renewable energy generation mostly from rooftop and large scale solar photovoltaic panels onshore wind enhanced geothermal systems wave climate change authority biomass and solar thermal generation see figure this is possible through the inclusion of both flexible and variable renewable energy technologies as well as advances in energy storage technologies which would also be widely used in the transport sector the remaining electricity demand is met by distributed supply mostly from renewable energy generation with one quarter or of total demand supplied by on site gas fired electricity generation in remote non grid integrated areas the mix of power generation technologies modelled for the illustrative pathway is based on work by the csiro depending on the commonwealth scientific and development of technologies costs and regulatory frameworks a near zero emissions power system could comprise different energy sources and mixes variants are explored in section industrial research organisation by industrial energy emissions decrease by nearly while the economic value added of industrial activities more than doubles metal ores metals and gas contribute nearly two thirds of the this can be thought of as a co benefit or spill over effect whereby a sector is unintentionally impacted by an action taken by another sector electricity generation plant technology performance and costs are based on bree c and the capital cost reduction time path developed by hayward graham total industrial energy related emissions in and of these emissions are attributable to commodities produced for exports across the mining sector energy intensity doubles instead of tripling or quadrupling in the absence of energy efficiency improvements at the same time manufacturing sector energy efficiency improvements continue in line with recent trends for the first two decades then capital stock replacements by more energy efficient stock drive increased energy efficiency industrial processes are electrified where feasible and there is a shift from coal to gas and increased use of bioenergy figure a process emissions and fugitive emissions are reduced via various means including process improvements materials substitution the partial use of bio coke in iron and steel production increased combustion catalyzation of gases with high global warming potential and ccs ccs is also applied to industrial process and fugitive emissions as well as to co emissions from fuel combustion for the liquefaction of natural gas where it has been applied for fugitive emissions global decarbonization drives changes in global demand for commodities in particular reduced demand for coal and oil is expected to drive decreases in coal and oil production of and respectively for some manufacturing activities including metals production iron steel and iron ore growth slows and consequently their proportional contribution to economic activity decreases conversely demand for non ferrous metals and other minerals such as uranium and lithium is expected to increase in addition some domestic trends are estimated to continue such as the progressive closure of all oil refining capacity in australia approximately one third of this capacity is expected to be substituted by biofuel refining figure a shows the industry energy demand by fuel source for the illustrative pathway australias production of coal is assumed to decrease in line with global demand further analysis could be conducted in the future on the relative competitiveness of the australian coal industry in a decarbonizing world which could help refine estimates of future australian coal production greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and residential buildings reduce by to due to significant energy efficiency electrification of direct fuel use e g gas for heating and the use of decarbonized electricity energy use per square meter of commercial building and per residential dwelling decreases by approximately there is strong growth in distributed grid integrated electricity generation in particular rooftop solar pv figure b shows the building energy demand trajectory a substantial shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric and hybrid vehicles and to a lesser extent hydrogen fuel cell vehicles results in over improvement in the energy efficiency of cars and light commercial vehicles gas is used extensively for road freight as a result oil use for road transport decreases by between and while vehicle kilometers travelled nearly double biofuels replace of oil use in aviation as this is one of the only decarbonization options currently available for this sector figure c shows the transport energy demand trajectory and figure shows the composition of drive train technologies from to for cars and light commercial vehicles and the fuel mix for freight and aviation over the same period soil and livestock emissions are reduced through the implementation of best practice farming techniques in particular for beef e g intensification of breeding improvement in feeding and pasture practices as well as enhanced breeding and herd selection for lower livestock methane emissions in addition a small relative reduction in beef demand is expected to result from increases in beef prices in a decarbonized world together these factors drive a reduction in emissions intensity of agricultural activity however this is not sufficient to compensate for the growth in activity that sees agricultural emissions grow by between today and some of this production and the associated emissions is attributable to exports feedstocks for the production of bioenergy are sourced from agricultural and forestry residues and wastes dedicated energy crops and grasslands and are used primarily in the aviation and mining sectors the increases in agriculture and forestry activities required to collect and gather this biomass has been accounted for in the modelling as already described in section australia has great potential to offset emissions via forestry bio sequestration under price incentives for afforestation large shifts in land use from agricultural land in particular grasslands to carbon forestry would become profitable however this would require significant development of supply chains as well as regional capabilities and workforces for the illustrative pathway the total uptake of carbon forestry was capped by the volume required to meet the budget recommended by australias climate change authority equivalent to approximately of the total economic potential identified the potential for generating energy from renewable resources in australia is far greater than australias total energy use today as such the challenge for australia is not the availability of renewable resources but harnessing the potential australia also has substantial potential for geological carbon storage with large potential storage basins across the country including a number in close proximity to fossil fuel reserves and major industrial areas the industrial scale gorgon carbon dioxide injection project is one of the worlds largest ccs projects under development it is expected to commence operation in and all government approvals for capturing and re injecting carbon dioxide from the extraction and processing of natural gas have been granted for this project despite recent increases australias rate of energy efficiency improvement is lower than in other major developed economies thus considerable potential for energy efficiency improvements remains and is modelled in the illustrative pathway energy efficiency improvements are driven by much higher energy efficiency in the new housing stock and domestic appliances within required to be built for australia s growing population in addition many of australias aging industrial assets are replaced with more energy efficient capital stock by as part of natural asset life cycles transport systems also have significant potential for greater energy efficiency through modal shift and urban planning the electrification of industrial processes will be necessary for all country pathways and electrification technologies are likely to be a global r d focus large technological advances in the potential for electrification e g heat pumps and conveyors are assumed even though many such technologies are not yet available and or not yet widely deployed australias non energy emissions are substantial compared with other industrialized countries and currently there are very few options for reducing or offsetting a large proportion of non energy emissions other than the use of bioenergy ccs and carbon forestry hence these technologies are likely to be critical to australias decarbonization pathway carbon forestry has large potential to offset emissions more than twice the amount that has been modelled so it could contribute more to decarbonization in the event that other technologies do not contribute to decarbonization to the extent anticipated the role of ccs in sequestering industrial process and fugitive emissions and fuel combustion emissions in lng production is highly dependent on ccs being demonstrated as viable including the long term risks of fugitive emissions socially acceptable and cost effective also at smaller scales aemo see also geoscience australia abare cocrc ccs institute cocrc by reducing total energy demand energy efficiency improvements enable low carbon energy supply to contribute a greater proportion to total energy supply energy efficiency is also the most cost effective way of reducing emissions electrification of industry and the use of bioenergy and or ccs may be interchangeable decarbonization options depending on the scale of substitution and corresponding marginal costs as such if one or more of the technologies is not deployed to the extent assumed in the modelling australia could still have the potential to decarbonize the use of bioenergy for fuel switching in industry will necessitate increased feedstock collection aggregation processing and distribution to end use locations and a focus on supply chain development if additional bioenergy is required there may be trade offs in the allocation of land for feedstocks with other land use needs including agriculture carbon forestry and ecosystem services this may limit the potential for further bioenergy fuel substitution in industry for the illustrative pathway grid supplied renewable energy electricity generation was modelled two additional electricity generation technology mixes were modelled as variants to demonstrate contingency for any uncertainty about the viability of the grid supplied renewable energy electricity pathway all three mixes result in a similar relative emissions intensity of electricity generation by well below the present intensity of tcoe mwh as summarized in table emissions from all electricity generation technology mixes could be further reduced by the use of biogas in on site and peak gas generation provided further resources in biogas are secured table electricity generation variants modelled generation mix in emissions intensity of electricity in tcoe mwh technology renewables grid ccs included nuclear included renewables gas onsite renewables coal ccs gas ccs gas renewables nuclear gas tcoe mwh tcoe mwh the illustrative pathway does not model behavioral changes or step changes in technology and only structural changes in response to domestic and global macroeconomic trends however deeper pathways could be achieved via the following behavior change smaller houses greater range of tolerance in heating cooling requirements where feasible less travel more widespread availability and better public transport increased proportion of less emissions intensive products in shopping decreased beef consumption substitution of business travel with teleconferencing preferential sourcing of less emissions intensive products and services structural change urban design for shift to rail for passenger travel and freight transport proactive and accelerated transition from emissions intensive manufacturing and mining to more services step changes in technologies bioenergy potential in australia is partially dependent on improvements in agricultural productivity given agricultural residues are a large component of potential feedstocks if agricultural productivity improves then the potential of bioenergy could increase for example based on the highest estimates of combined feedstock availability an additional pj of biomass could be used to replace gas and oil use in industry and transport driving a further emissions reduction of nearly mtco in or tco capita if ccs for small scale fuel combustion applications could be developed cost effectively it could be applied to reduce energy emissions from many of australias energy intensive sectors for example ccs applied to a third of all cement and non ferrous metals production sites excluding aluminum could lead to a further reduction in industrial emissions of over mtcoin or tco capita breakthroughs in fuel cell technology could lead to fuel cell vehicles penetrating the market sooner than modelled for example if half of the gas used for road freight was replaced by hydrogen by this could lead to a further reduction in transport emissions of mtco or tco capita the cost of renewable energy technologies has fallen faster than anticipated and further future breakthroughs could speed up decarbonization offering greater decarbonization options flexibility of breakthroughs in storage technology particularly batteries could see a more rapid adoption of electrification and distributed renewable energy generation material efficiency e g through d printing could significantly reduce emissions by reducing the demand for minerals and base metals depending on the life cycle emissions of materials required for manufacture there are various technological economic social and political challenges implementing decarbonization pathways in australia however this report focuses on the technological challenges which include to demonstrating the viability of decarbonization technologies e g ccs energy storage emerging renewables such as wave and enhanced geothermal systems and rigorous carbon forestry accounting standards developing the supply chains and workforce for new technologies and services e g bioenergy carbon forestry technologies and accounting methods in a decarbonized world australias abundant renewable energy resources could form the basis of a new comparative advantage in low carbon energy generation replacing the existing comparative advantage possessed through fossil fuels realizing this comparative advantage could result in a revival in energy intensive manufacturing such as aluminum smelting and the potential to develop renewable energy carriers for export markets such as biogas or solar thermal based energy carriers the prerequisite for these co benefits is that all major producing economies face strong carbon constraints either through their domestic frameworks or through import demand favoring products from zero carbon sources australia has the opportunity to be a global leader in ccs expertise and technology development thanks to its great potential for carbon capture and storage prospects for the extraction refining and export of minerals such as non ferrous metals and ores uranium lithium and other precious metals may also be attractive australias substantial potential for bioenergy generation and bio sequestration could contribute for instance to the economic revitalization of regional and rural communities biodiversity protection and improved water quality land management practices offer the opportunity to simultaneously address climate change biodiversity health and social and cultural inclusion challenges other co benefits include better air quality and improved health due to reduced fossil fuel use increased production levels due to improved energy efficiency and workforce productivity gains in more naturally lit and energy efficient workplaces indigenous led carbon mitigation projects applying traditional the fundamental enabler for the decarbonization of the australian economy is the simultaneous decarbonization of all other major industrialized countries for australian industries to remain competitive in global markets their competitors in other countries must also be exposed to the decarbonization pressures and drivers this will also encourage public and private sector r d efforts focused on low carbon technologies such as electrification ccs and bioenergy australia faces the risk of locking in energy intensive assets especially for new vehicles buildings industrial plants mines and power stations to ensure new technology developments can contribute effectively and efficiently to deep decarbonization clear signals about australias likely long term emissions pathways are required to inform investment decisions government has a vital role to play in providing predictability of policy settings in order to minimize investment hold ups and to reduce the risk of suboptimal investment decisions see for instance eady grundy battaglia keating stucley et al green minchin the development of decarbonization technologies and their costs is subject to steep and often unpredictable learning curves a portfolio approach to r d investment in technologies is required to maximize the chances of developing technologies that will achieve the deepest emissions reductions at the lowest costs long term approaches for the development and deployment of these solutions will be required and key areas for further investigation include r d for renewable energy technologies storage and grid integration planning for increased electrification of the economy including the transport system ccs including r d and deployment of stand alone industrial applications continued energy efficiency improvement throughout the economy applied research and on ground experiments to determine tree species soil types and growing investigation of options for zero carbon energy industries conditions that will maximize the potential for carbon forestry r d on advanced bio sequestration options and large scale production of biofuels and reducing food waste and the emissions attributable to the food production transition to a decarbonized world will require new forms of

dramatically reduce co emissions from energy and industrial process related activities emissions would need to be transformed from tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita tcoe cap in to less than tcoe cap in this represents a nearly reduction in emissions from levels by the canadian context presents a number of challenges related to achieving deep decarbonization first national circumstances create structural to decarbonization challenges include canadas vast land area which drives substantial transportation demand climate which drives winter heating and summer cooling demand and the importance of the resource extraction sector to the economy impediments second canadas natural resource development aspirations are consistent with a global oc pathway only if deep decarbonization technologies are deployed global demand for fossil fuels and other primary resources is projected to rise even in deep decarbonization scenarios as a result the continued development of canadas fossil fuel and mineral natural resources for global export can be consistent with a c pathway however this requires that transformative ghg mitigation technologies be deployed at every stage including extraction processing and end use third significant political economic and technical barriers to deep decarbonization need to be overcome both in canada and abroad technical constraints currently limit the availability of many options such as hydrogen use for personal travel and significant research development and deployment efforts will be needed both domestically and internationally cost and competitiveness outcomes are other challenges that must be overcome for technologies to be widely deployed such as ccs finally even options that meet both of these feasibility criteria may fail to be implemented due to public opposition and political pressures the canadian analysis presented in this chapter considers and incorporates these factors however in order to achieve the objective of the current phase of the ddpp processidentifying national technological pathways to deep decarbonizationthe analysis also looks beyond current political realities and envisions a hypothetical future in which canada and other nations are aligned on the need excludes lulucf emissions to implement stringent policies to drive these changes and international competitiveness concerns associated with differential action are alleviated another important simplifying assumption in the analysis is that the canadian emission reductions are achieved domestically despite the fact that access to globally sourced ghg reduction opportunities will be politically and economically important to canadas decarbonization effort these assumptions are necessary in order to look beyond the status quo and investigate the transformative technological pathways that deep decarbonization in canada will require the insights gained from this analysis can then be used to inform policy discussions as well as identify the implications of global decarbonization driven technological shifts for canadas economy in total canadian ghg emissions including lulucf were mtcoe equivalent to tcoe per capita excluding lulucf as shown in figure emissions are dominated by the industrial and transportation sectors and driven by the use of fossil fuels particularly refined petroleum products and natural gas note combustion co emissions does not include upstream fugitive emissions mt in between and energy related emissions rose by mt coe driven by population and economic growth figure a industrial output particularly in the oil and gas sectors has risen substantially and the growing population and economy have spurred increasing transportation demand these factors have been offset by improvements in energy efficiency between and energy efficiency regulations drove an improvement of approximately in the average fuel efficiency of the canadian car fleet and approximately in the heating energy intensity of new residential buildings while the overall carbon intensity of energy use did not change significantly between and canadian electricity production has started shifting toward lower and zero emission sources the canadian federal government recently imposed regulations effectively requiring all new and retrofitted electricity generation to have the ghg intensity of a natural gas combined cycle gas turbine or better each province also has carbon regulations in place that drive electricity decarbonization such as feed in tariffs and a coal fired power ban in ontario a flexible levy on marginal industrial emissions in alberta a renewable portfolio standard in new brunswick and nova scotia and a net zero ghg standard for new generation in british columbia the canadian deep decarbonization pathway examines the major shifts in technology adoption energy use and economic structure that are consistent with continued growth in the population and economy and a nearly reduction in ghg emissions from levels by it is important to remember that this pathway is not a forecast but rather an illustrative scenario designed to identify technology related needs challenges uncertainties and opportunities the analysis is based on a set of global and domestic assumptions about key emissions drivers technology availability and economic activity in order to reveal the technological pathways to deep decarbonization in canada current political realities were suspended and important assumptions were made related to demand for canadian oil and gas exports commercial availability of transformative technologies the availability of globally sourced ghg reductions and the extent to which global decarbonization creates new export opportunities for canadian goods and services these assumptions are discussed at the end of this section a technology specific energy economy model cims was then used to simulate the energy using technology pathways that firms and individuals would follow under the ddpp scenario the results provide insight into the key areas where decarbonization will occur as well as where deep emission reductions will be challenging to achieve the canadian deep decarbonization pathway achieves an overall ghg emission reduction of nearly mtcoe from levels by while maintaining strong economic growth see table over this period gdp rises from trillion to trillion real usd a tripling of canadas economy table development indicators and energy service demand drivers population millions gdp per capita capita price the reduction in emissions is driven most significantly by a dramatic reduction in the carbon intensity of energy use as renewables and biomass become the dominant energy sources and there is broad fuel switching across the economy toward electricity and biofuels figure and figurea electricity production nearly completely decarbonizes figure b overall the carbon intensity of canadas total primary energy supply declines by between and this result is resilient to several technology scenarios if biofuels are not viable the transport stock could transition to increased use of electricity generated with renewables and fossil fuels with ccs especially if better batteries become available if ccs is not available the electricity sector could decarbonize using more renewables and or nuclear and vice versa net lulucf emissions are omitted in the ddpp process the other major driver of emission reductions is the dramatic reduction in the energy intensity of the economy between and as shown in figurea and pillar of figure b end use energy consumption rises by only over this period compared to a increase in gdp this is due to both structural changes in the economy and energy efficiency the economy diversifies away from the industrial sector to some extent and within the industrial sector output from the refining cement and lime sectors falls compared to the reference case scenario while output from the electricity biodiesel and ethanol sectors rises output from the oil and gas sector falls slightly from the reference case but it still doubles in combination these factors drive a nearly complete decarbonization of the buildings transportation and electricity sectors as shown in figure by canadas remaining emissions in the deep decarbonization scenario come primarily from industry two of the core foundations of the canadian deep decarbonization pathwaynearly complete decarbonization of the buildings and transportation sectorsare well understood with significant progress already achieved other elements of the pathway are less certain and more susceptible to global factors including global demand and hence emissions from the heavy industrial and energy extraction and processing sectors and the availability of transformative ghg abatement technologies to address these uncertainties the canadian analysis is based on four key characteristics international demand for crude oil and natural gas remains substantial under a deep decarbonization scenario as a result oil and gas production as well as the end use of fossil fuels substantially decarbonize by and the sector is able to remain a thriving contributor to the national economy this assumption is discussed further in technical options and assumptions for national deep decarbonization the analysis assumes that all emission reductions are achieved domestically despite the importance of lower cost global reductions to achieving decarbonization in canada this assumption is being made by all country teams since the ddpp process is focused on identifying the decarbonization pathways and technical changes that are likely to drive deep emission reductions in each country however in practice international cooperation to maximize the efficiency of worldwide emission reduction efforts will be critical global demand patterns for canadian goods and services do not change depending on the decarbonization pathways followed by other countries demand for various canadian goods and services could increase potentially including biomass as cellulosic ethanol or biodiesel primary metals iron nickel zinc rare earths and uranium fertilizers both from mined potash and nitrogen ammonia based sources derived from natural gas and or energy efficiency technologies particularly in the vehicle sector however the scope and scale of this impact is highly uncertain these dynamics will be explored in future phases of the ddpp there will be significant domestic innovation and global spillovers in transformative low carbon technologies leading to the commercial viability of next generation cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel as well as ccs in the electricity generation natural gas processing hydrogen production and industrial sectors these assumptions are discussed further in technical options and assumptions for national deep decarbonization in the deep decarbonization scenario the canadian energy supply is transformed between and over this period consumption of electricity rises nearly from to twh while the sectors total emissions fall by from to mtco as shown in figure this is led by an increase in the share of renewable energy hydro wind solar and biomass in the generation mix and supported by the use of ccs to decarbonize coal and natural gas fuelled generation nuclear output was assumed to remain constant due to facility siting and political challenges oil and natural gas consumption decline while biofuels become the core liquid fuel and hydrogen enters the energy mix figure b sufficient access to the feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel was assumed however the electricity generation mix does not include net sequestration of biomass given insufficient information regarding the availability of sufficient sustainable feedstock due to these fuel supply shifts by the electricity transportation and building sectors have almost completely decarbonized and the canadian emissions profile is dominated by a subset of industrial emissions that are very difficult and expensive to reduce table the following sections highlight the key changes that drive emission reductions in each of these sectors table remaining ghg emissions in by sector of total sector of total electricity transportation buildings industry agriculture note total exceeds due to rounding overall transportation sector emissions fall by between and from to mtco in the personal and freight transportation sectors this decarbonization is initially driven by vehicle efficiency improvements and then by substantial fuel switching to biofuels predominantly cellulosic ethanol for personal transport and biodiesel for freight transport electricity and hydrogen figure c note carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production energy efficiency regulations have already led to substantial ghg reductions in the transportation sector and new vehicle stock is on track to almost completely decarbonize by the late s or early s if regulatory goals continue to strengthen at their recent rate passenger kilometers travelled remain fairly constant while freight movement per dollar of gdp falls by between and as the economy becomes less dependent on the movement of freight structurally there is a slight mode shift from personal vehicles to mass transportation transit bus and rail while in the freight transportation sector the use of heavy trucks declines substantially primarily in favor of rail overall building sector emissions fall by between and from to mtco the bulk of the emission reductions are the result of fuel switching with natural gas use virtually eliminated and electricity providing nearly all of the sectors energy by figure b air and ground source heat pumps are the primary energy supply technologies in use with some peaking with baseboard electric heat per capita residential floor area remains fairly constant while the commercial sector becomes more space efficient and commercial floor area per dollar of gdp falls by building energy efficiency has already improved substantially and forthcoming energy efficiency regulations will continue to drive reductions in space heating energy use keeping the sector on a trajectory toward nearly complete decarbonization industrial emissions fall by between and from to mtcoe the structure of the industrial sector shifts with output from the refining and cement and lime sectors falling compared to the reference case and output from the electricity ethanol and biodiesel sectors rising while slightly lower than in the reference case output from the oil and gas sector still doubles the vast majority of the industrial sectors emissions reductions are a result of fuel switching particularly to electricity and the widespread adoption of ccs to reduce chemical by product and process heat related emissions figure a process emission controls are also put in place for the cement and lime chemical production iron and steel and oil and gas extraction sectors while not the focus of the ddpp at this stage this study included an analysis of strategies to reduce agricultural non co ghg emissions and the canadian decarbonization pathway includes an reduction in these emissions between and from to mtcoe these reductions result from efforts to reduce atmospheric emissions due to enteric fermentation manure management and agricultural soils and include measures such as methane capture controlled anaerobic digestion and flaring or generation and no till agricultural practices the canadian decarbonization pathway is dominated by four major dynamics providing insight into the key areas where canada can take action to decarbonize reinforced and deepened energy efficiency improvement trends in all energy end uses eventual decarbonization of the electricity sector fuel switching to lower carbon fuels and decarbonized energy carriers e g electricity transport biofuels and hydrogen and direct ghg reduction for industrial processes and thermal heat generation e g via carbon capture and storage and process changes this section discusses each of these decarbonization opportunities and the key assumptions and uncertainties involved end use energy efficiency improvements are a key decarbonization pathway in canada particularly in the transportation and buildings sectors energy efficiency roughly doubles in both sectors by which is consistent with the trajectory already established by existing and forthcoming efficiency regulations decarbonizing electricity production is essential since it is a precondition to reducing emissions throughout the rest of the economy through electrification to decarbonize canadas electricity generation stock investment in a wide range of low emitting electric generation technologies will need to more than double from baseline levels in the deep decarbonization scenario our modelling assumes that the cost and capacity factors of wind and solar improve to a degree that allows of generation to come from wind and from solar pv both require restructuring of electricity markets and transmission grids to allow for and encourage high intermittent renewable content in addition to intermittent renewables significant deployment of ccs will be required to facilitate large scale switching to decarbonized electricity the analysis assumes that post combustion ccs will be commercially viable for the electricity sector by and that eventually solid oxide fuel cells which provide a virtually pure co waste stream or a technology of equivalent ghg intensity will be used to achieve approximately co capture the canadian decarbonization pathway includes significant fuel switching to decarbonized energy carriers with the transportation industrial and residential commercial sectors switching to electricity hydrogen and advanced biofuels fuel switching in the transportation sector will require further developments in batteries less so for hybrid and plug in hybrid vehicles and hydrogen storage fuel switching to advanced biofuels will also depend on the development of a decarbonized fuel source with adequate feedstocks e g cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel based on woody biomass or algae and significant technological innovation to make these fuels commercially available to achieve significant decarbonization a cost effective method of reducing chemical by product e g from natural gas processing and hydrogen cement lime and steel production and process heat related emissions is essential this will require the deployment of ccs in these sectors along with other transformative technologies that are not yet commercially available e g down hole oxy combustion or in situ electrothermal extraction in the petroleum extraction sector and switching from pyro to hydro metallurgy in metal smelting as mentioned previously the canadian deep decarbonization pathway assumes that international demand for crude oil and natural gas remains substantial if international oil prices remain above the cost of production continued growth of the canadian oil sands sector with decarbonization measures can be consistent with deep emission reduction efforts and would support continued economic development the literature conflicts on whether production from the oil sands can be cost effective in a deep decarbonization scenario the answer depends on policy the cost of reducing production emissions and assumptions regarding transport energy use and efficiency however the international energy agencys world energy outlook indicates that even in a ppm world oil sands production could remain at levels similar to today or higher several elements of the canadian decarbonization pathways are well understood and are expected to provide an essential foundation for deep decarbonization under all pathways such as energy efficiency improvements in the buildings and transportation sectors other elements depend on technological innovation and stronger climate policy signals and their future contribution to canadian emissions reductions is more uncertain the commercial availability of ccs falls into this latter category since the technology is not commercially viable with current climate policy stringency if ccs does not achieve commercial viability in the electricity production sector or is blocked due to public acceptability concerns alternative decarbonization pathways could be based on increased generation from either nuclear power or renewables the canadian decarbonization pathway assumes that nuclear generation is limited to current installed capacity due to the challenges associated with siting new facilities however if public acceptance and siting challenges were overcome this constraint could be relaxed renewables such as solar and wind power are already projected to play a major role in electricity generation by they have the theoretical potential to expand further but their intermittency is a limiting factor and further expansion would depend on development of a north american wide high voltage direct current transmission grid to balance renewable supply and demand or significant breakthroughs in storage technologies the analysis also assumes substantial deployment of ccs to address process heat emissions in natural gas processing hydrogen production and industrial sectors if this does not occur the key alternative is direct electrification of industrial processes such as substituting hydro metallurgy for pyro metallurgy the canadian decarbonization pathway also includes significant fuel switching to cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel in the transportation sector which relies on the assumption that these fuels will be commercially viable however the transportation sector has more flexibility than many other sectors since biofuels electricity and hydrogen all contribute to the sectors emission reductions if biofuels are international energy agency iea world energy outlook www worldenergyoutlook org not available alternative decarbonization pathways could be based on greater electrification of transportation or more aggressive fuel switching to hydrogen although there are currently technical issues with practical hydrogen storage in personal vehicles and there is currently no hydrogen supply network the canadian decarbonization pathway was developed by using a technology rich stock turnover simulation model which includes and evaluates both currently available technologies and those still under development but with the potential for future commercial availability the canadian pathway is extremely aggressive and ambitious reducing emissions by nearly between and as a result few additional measures and deeper pathways are available one emission reduction option that is currently being investigated in canada is accelerated weathering of mine wastes some mine tailings mineralize atmospheric carbon dioxide and researchers are working on accelerating this process both abiotically and microbially this could offset the ghg emissions from mining projects and has the theoretical potential to sequester much larger quantities of emissions turning mine wastes into a significant carbon sinks another known decarbonization pathway not included in this version of the analysis is the full suite of potential options for switching from pyro metallurgy using heat to hydro metallurgy using acid solutions and electricity in the metal smelting sectors finally another pathway that may allow deeper reductions is the use of biomass with ccs in electricity generation to create net sequestration electricity production we have not considered this option due to potential feedstock limitation issues the fossil fuel production and mineral extraction sectors play a major role in the canadian economy however their export oriented nature is a challenge since they create significant production emissions in canada even though the outputs are consumed in other countries the commercial availability of ccs will be essential to economically address these emissions more broadly many of the major changes described in the canadian decarbonization pathway will not occur without strong policy signals which will require public support and in many cases will be driven by public pressure whether domestically or indirectly through external market access pressures technological innovation and deployment is a critical component of the canadian pathway but large scale deployment of new technologies is dependent on public acceptance which must be earned through continued engagement and dialogue and cannot be assumed a significant knowledge gap in the canadian decarbonization pathway is how global decarbonization efforts will change demand for products and services that support low carbon development and in which canada has a competitive advantage changing global demand patterns could lead to the expansion of existing industries or the development of new industries dampening adverse decarbonization impacts and supporting continued economic development dipple g et al carbon mineralization in mine waste available online at http www cmc nce ca wp content uploads greg dipple pdf international cooperation is required to support research development and deployment of critical decarbonization technologies as well as to implement a global equimarginal abatement effort through ghg reduction sales and purchases technical constraints make the marginal cost of emissions abatement based on currently available technologies very high in the heavy industrial and energy extraction and processing sectors compared to other canadian decarbonization options and to the cost of reducing emissions in many other countries a focus on global rather than purely national emission reductions is the most efficient way to address this challenge while the current phase of the ddpp project focused on identifying national technological pathways this topic will be key in the next phase of the ddpps work the canadian deep decarbonization scenario depends on significant technological innovation and deployment this requires both domestic investment and innovation and global research cooperation and technology spillovers to remain on the path toward deep decarbonization increased investment and accelerated research development and deployment efforts will be required in the following priority areas improving post combustion ccs for both electricity generation and industrial process applications development and commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells and other technologies including pre combustion capture that either reduce ghg intensity or reduce the cost of ccs by producing a pure co waste stream enhanced transmission grid flexibility and energy storage technologies to allow more electricity generation from intermittent renewables development and commercialization of cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuels derived from woody biomass algae or other feedstocks and development and commercialization of batteries and hydrogen storage to enable electrification and fuel switching to hydrogen in the transportation sector in parallel with efforts to collaborate on the deployment of critical enabling technologies addressing the significant differential in abatement opportunities and marginal abatement costs across countries and sectors must be an international priority while challenging to implement a global equimarginal abatement effort through ghg reduction sales and purchases has the potential to be the most efficient way to achieve the global target while maintaining strong economic growth despite fast growth over the last decade with an average gdp growth rate of over china is still a developing country with a low level of economic development in its gdp was billion us and per capita gdp was just us chinas has a very significant secondary sector of the economy which contributed to gdp in but this sectors contribution has declined by percentage points since while the tertiary sector of the economy increased by percentage points due to economic and social development chinas level of urbanization has risen from in to in with a increase in urbanization rate million chinese inhabitants move to cities every year to pursue a higher standard of living china is also the most populous country in the world by the end of chinas population was billion about of the world total although china has made remarkable progress it is under heavy pressure to improve environmental protection due its resource intensive development xi jinping chinas president has described the countrys recent model of economic development as unsustainable not least because pollution is harming lives and livelihoods particularly in cities china recognizes the problems created by pollution both from greenhouse gases ghgs that cause climate change and from other gases and particles china is also facing growing constraints due to the limited availability of natural resources other than coal chinas leadership has signaled its intention to accelerate the transformation of chinas growth model to make china an innovative country and to promote more efficient equal and sustainable economic development according to second national communication on climate change in chinas total ghg emissions were approximately gt coeq of which carbon dioxide accounted for methane for nitrous oxide for and fluorinated gases for the total net ghg removals through land use change and forestry was about mt co eq of total ghg emissions energy activities represent in gtco with direct emissions from electricity industry transportation and buildings at mtco mtco mtco and mtco respectively figure a the major emitting energy activities are the coal intensive power generation and industrial sectors figure b notably as the main sector driving economic growth the industry sector accounts for of total nal energy consumption and almost of total energy related co emissions in this is essentially from a few energy intensive industries which consume about of energy use in the industry sector iron and steel cement synthesis ammonia and ethylene production source second national communication on climate change the growth of chinas economy has been the major driver of increasing emissions in the past three decades the structure of this growth has had opposite dynamics over the last decades with direct consequences on emissions during the first ten years of chinas openness policies structural change favored lower emission activities and helped to decouple emissions from aggregate growth this was followed by a rapid process of industrialization which saw a double digit growth rate in the heavy industries this industrialization accelerated growth in emissions faster than gdp though this was tempered in the th five year plan this shows the crucial impact of economic structure on chinas future emission rates coal has dominated chinas energy mix over the past decades supporting economic growth with a high carbon intensity fuel the only factor that has significantly contributed to slow the rate of growth in emissions has been energy efficiency as seen in the reduction of chinas energy intensity per unit of gdp figure a electricity generation has been the major driver of the increase in carbon emissions since the growing needs for electricity have been satisfied by the fast development of coal based power units although china is now the country with the highest emission levels current and historical per capita emissions are still lower than ipcc annex i country levels whether on an annual tcoe cap or cumulative tcoe cap over basis given these recent trends continuously increasing emissions can be expected in the future with business as usual economic growth the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway combines an acceleration of the evolution of economic structure reductions in energy intensity and the promotion of non fossil fuel energy to control emissions in a context of continued economic growth gdp per capita is assumed to increase by more than times from to to satisfy development needs but energy trends are significantly decoupled from this growth with an increase of primary and final energy of from ej in to ej in and from ej in to ej in respectively figure this increase is mainly triggered by the industrial sector buildings sector and transportation sector along with changes in economic structure an increase in urbanization rate and the completion of the industrialization process in particular the share of coal in primary energy consumption falls to in while the use of natural gas and non fossil fuels increase contributing and respectively table the development indicators and energy service demand drivers in china population millions gdp per capita capita price in the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway energy related co emissions decrease by from gtco in to gtco in essentially due to a decrease of both the primary energy per unit of gdp by and of energy related co emissions per unit of energy by figure a the former is largely explained by structural change with a large decrease of the share of energy intensive sectors of the economy and improvement of economy wide energy efficiency the latter mainly comes from decarbonizing the power sector and the electrification of end uses from in to while increasing living standards and modernizing energy use patterns figure b the application of ccs technologies in power generation and the industrial sector is also a crucial feature of this illustrative pathway contributing gtco and gtco respectively at the sectoral level the industry sector emissions remain the largest but buildings and transportation increase in share from in to of emissions figure electrification is an important indicator of economic and social development and electricity consumption in the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario is projected to reach twh in or kwh per capita around times the level since thermal power especially from coal is an important source of local pollutants and ghgs the decarbonization of power sector is of significance for the achievement of low carbon development the carbon emission intensity of power generation in will decrease from gco kwh in to gco kwh in figure a this is permitted by the large scale use of nuclear which reaches of electricity production in intermittent renewables installed capacity of wind and solar respectively equal gw and gw in contributing and of electricity generation respectively and hydro which accounts for an additional fossil fuel power generation units still represent of electricity generation in notably because natural gas power generation technologies act as an important back up technology for intermittent generation technologies fossil based emissions are reduced by a large percentage due to the deployment of efficient technology options notably all new coal power plants after will be supercritical ultra supercritical or igcc power generation technologies and ccs facilities on of coal power plants and of natural gas power plants this diffusion supposes that ccs technology will become commercialized after energy efficiency could be improved by a large degree through technological innovation in industrial sectors this would permit a reduction of energy consumption per value added of the industry sector by from to limiting the rise of final energy consumption to from ej in to ej in by promoting the transformation of coal fired boilers to gas fired boilers and enhancing the use of electricity the illustrative pathway reduces the share of coal from in to in while increasing that of gas and electricity in final energy use since its hard to change feed composition in some industries it is not expected that further significant changes in energy structure are possible in addition structural changes in industry could be achieved through developing strategic industries controlling overcapacity of main industry outputs and eliminating backward production capacity notably many high energy intensive industry sectors will experience a slower growth and the output of some high energy intensive industry products notably cement and crude steel are anticipated peak by e g replacing converter with electric furnace or using waste heat of low temperature flue gas in sintering and pelletizing in iron and steel industry and replacing vertical shaft kilns with new dry production process and enforcing low temperature cogeneration in cement industry these different options lead a decrease of co emissions in the industry sector particularly due to the contribution of ccs technology if ccs is deployed appropriately on a commercialized scale after in key industry sectors it is expected to sequester of total co emissions in the industry sector in figure a total floor area will continue to grow from billion m in to billion m in and the urban and rural residential building floor areas per capita will increase reaching around m and m respectively in parallel with the process of urbanization this pushes total energy consumption up by from ej to ej in line with a increase of energy consumption per capita energy efficiency measures play an important role in limiting this rise of energy demand where performance improves by and from to for commercial urban residential and rural residential units respectively and appliance energy efficiency increases e g and for regular and central air conditioners the proportion of coal in energy use decreases gradually from in to in as electricity and gas rise reaching and in respectively this triggers a decrease of the average carbon emission intensity from gco mj in to gco mj in that ensures a lower emissions level in compared to figure b pushed by rising mobility demand along with wealth increase a ten fold increase of kilometers per capita to reach km cap in energy consumption in transport will almost triple from ej in to ej in representing a rising share of total energy consumption from in to in a partial decoupling will allow the carbon emissions to rise by only from mtco in to mtco in due to transport mode shifts an increase of vehicle fuel economy and the promotion of electricity and biofuel use figure c the primary mode shift encompasses a transition from on road to off road modes of transport where rail and water transport grow over time in freight transportation road transportation is limited to in water transportation maintains the highest share about in and railway grows to within the passenger transportation road transportation will be kept at in and railway transportation will remain the main transportation mode of total passenger mobility in notably due to the development of high speed railway and rail based transit systems in cities attaining km by times higher than in for the on road transportation improvement of transportation management is an important option to control the rapid growth of demand an increase in fuel economy is also crucial with a improvement of light duty vehicles energy intensity and the deployment of high efficiency diesel vehicles in freight transportation and even more importantly the share of gasoline and diesel vehicles sold significantly decreases by because of the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles in intra city transportation low carbon vehicles gradually play a more dominant role with the adoption of pure electric vehicles plug in hybrid electric vehicle phev biofuels and fuel cell vehicles fcv a reduction in gasoline and diesel use also occurs because of railway electrification which will play a dominant role in the railway energy mix by note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes both direct end use emissions and indirect emissions related to electricity production emphasizing technology development and innovation is vital for the achievement of the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway sufficient input on technology r d and incentives for technology deployment are necessary in order to achieve the decarbonization pathway significant technological and economic effort needs to be made in different sectors and low carbon technologies must be distributed across the country the most important low carbon options especially energy saving technologies in end use sectors in the illustrative pathway are discussed below transport high efficiency diesel vehicle or gasoline cars electricity vehicles plug in hybrid vehicles and fuel cell vehicles in passenger transport a improvement of fuel economy for conventional high duty vehicles fully electrified rail based transit for both long distance and short distance by buildings increasing energy efficiency for both existing and new buildings through innovative technologies like advanced low carbon buildings which will increase their share in urban regions from in to in and help to reduce the heating and cooling demand to substitute for coal boilers the application of advanced heating facilities such as ground source heat pumps and decentralized solar heating systems as well as natural gas boilers and chp for centralized heating development of high energy efficiency cooling systems lighting system and appliances the large scale use of renewable energy such as solar water heaters in residential buildings industry high efficiency waste heat recycling technologies high efficiency boilers and motors across all sectors energy saving technologies in high energy intensive industries permitting a fall from to of the energy consumption per unit of product output of crude steel cement ammonia and ethylene by and respectively electricity generation an increased reliance on non fossil fuel power generation technologies is the major contributor to the reduction in the carbon intensity of electricity generation hydro power production of gw approaches its potential by wind power reaches gw in off shore solar energy power generation experiences a fast development where solar pv and solar thermal reach approximately gw and gw respectively in biomass fired power generation and other renewables will be limited due to resource constraints and high relative cost nuclear power generation technologies will be developed due to learning from foreign advanced technologies and domestic research and demonstration and exceed gw by ccs technologies will be another important technology and will be deployed in both the power and industry sectors at scale in it is expected that ccs is developed and demonstrated from and deployed at a commercialized scale from both co utilization and geologic storage have great potential compared to the amount of co captured in the illustrative pathway to billion ton per year for the former more than billion ton annually for the latter in order to achieve the illustrative decarbonization pathway there are key measures that must deviate significantly from current trends this includes a low carbon transition in electricity generation even as electricity demand increases faster than gains in end use energy efficiency the former dimension depends on the development and deployment of non fossil fuel power generation the improvement in energy efficiency concerns key industrial sectors vehicles urban buildings and residential appliances there are still uncertainties with some key measures and technologies that might affect the achievement of this pathway such as the integration of intermittent renewable power into the power system application of ccs facilities supply of natural gases and penetration of electric vehicles in case the magnitude of the measures discussed above is less than assumed some alternative approaches could be envisioned leading to different emissions scenarios for example the proportion of non fossil fuel electricity is in in the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway of which nuclear power represents a share of however if the nuclear development is hindered in the future coal power with ccs or renewable power might grow in its place increase reliance on wind and solar energy in the power sector is possible though it largely depends on the possibility of developing new energy storage solutions or enough natural gas power units to manage the resource intermittency a large portion of chinas emissions are linked to the process of urbanization since large quantities of construction materials will be required to build and maintain urban infrastructure especially cement and steel measures to decrease the demolition of buildings and transportation infrastructures will contribute to further deeper decarbonization by combining a reduction of material consumption intensity and reuse of waste construction materials the early deployment of key mitigation technologies can help china follow a deeper decarbonization pathway that will also contribute to the growth of chinas economy in other ways notably the large scale of the chinese market production economies of scale and learning by doing can help accelerate cost reductions and diffusion of low carbon energy options in line with chinas development strategy to grow strategic emerging industries chinas growth has been characterized by a high saving and investment rate in the past three decades in the future china will maintain its growth rate around reduce its saving and investment rate and increase the share of consumption in its gdp to maintain the growth rate at a relatively high level while reducing the investment rate china needs to increase the productivity of its investment deep decarbonization strategies can contribute to this gain in productivity through shifting the structure of the economy towards less capital intensive sectors e g from industrial sectors to service sectors improving the efficiency of capital investment to produce output especially through energy saving and increase the productivity of other factors especially labor and energy china s future development is the source of much uncertainty when examining potential emission reduction pathways first the level of economic growth is largely uncertain the average chinese growth rate has been a little more than in the past twenty years the th cpc national congress has projected that the gdp growth rate will be around in the next decade this reduction of to percentage points is more than the typical growth rate of developed countries china s economy will continue to develop at a relatively high speed varying from to this expected variation will have a significant impact on the actual level of energy demand the second aspect is future adjustments to industrial structure and changes in the mode of development chinas energy consumption per unit of gdp is twice the average level of the world which means there is a significant opportunity for reductions in energy intensity however the decline cannot depend on incremental technology change because chinas power plants are newly built with efficient supercritical and ultra supercritical units and for energy intensive industries the efficiency gap compared to developed countries is low therefore the focal point in china is to adjust the industrial structure and change the mode of development towards less heavy and chemical industry as well as less production of energy consuming products like steel and cement nevertheless the issues of how to adjust and how to identify the degree and intensity of the adjustment have great uncertainties the third aspect is urbanization triggered by the demand of social development the demand for steel and cement is very large in the process of urbanization according to estimates there may be an increase of percentage point in the urbanization rate each year finally exports are an important factor in the economy production of which significantly contributes to total emissions currently of energy is used for the production of export products in china and given that adjustments of the structure of exports is not an easy task manufacturing exports and associated emissions are expected to remain important in the long run this area of potential emission reductions would benefit from further investigation the reduction of co emissions is not only a response to climate change but it also addresses the urgent demand of developing the national economy if the coordination works well the strategy of climate change mitigation and sustainable development will lead to a win win situation the guiding ideology and the concept of development must be changed among all cadres the central government should understand the trade off between gdp growth highly dependent on resource industry and the cost paid for resources losses the central and western regions need to be redesigned and readjusted so as to draw more attention to climate change at the same time the evaluation mechanism of officials must be revised the promotion of a position should not only rely on the growth rate of gdp but should also look at a comprehensive analysis of gain and loss the reform of the energy sector needs to be promoted including the reform of the price system and fiscal taxation system although china s energy price remains high in developing countries the price structure and pricing system is very reasonable especially that of coal and electricity the current price of coal and electricity does not include the environmental cost and so the exploitation of resources does great damage to the environment the reform of resource taxes and the proposal of a carbon tax must be considered in energy policy along with the price system and fiscal and financial field china has established pilot emissions trading schemes etss at provincial and city levels with a view to establish a national ets around the future development of chinas ets should build upon the experience gained in regional pilots and resemble the approach taken in the eu ets and the australian and californian schemes a careful design is key for the success of chinas ets especially in the electricity sector as is practical and reliable company level measurements reporting and verification of emissions an early stage of harmonization with design of other international etss will facilitate the linkage with these etss in the future methods for reducing the use of coal have many synergistic effects the main way to improve the domestic environment is to reduce coal mining substantial coal mining not only consumes a large amount of water but it also leads to slag penetration and deposition resulting in the serious pollution of groundwater resources in addition coal mining causes the collapse of areas that have been mined the area of subsidence in china has reached km furthermore conventional pollutants such as sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and dust including the thick fog and haze weather in beijing and tianjin are partly caused by burning coal therefore the reduction of coal consumption is essential for china to improve domestic environmental quality france has a low endowment of domestic fossil resources domestic production represents less than of primary consumption and energy imports mostly oil and gas are a substantial source of total external trade deficit these imports represent around billion us a deficit close to the total external trade deficit in faced with this situation france has developed a specific energy security strategy resorting notably to the launching of an important nuclear energy program in the s today france is in particular equipped with gwe of installed nuclear capacity which supplies of the electricity produced and of total final energy as a result france is today already a relatively low energy consumption country toe cap and has ghg emission intensities at the lowest end of oecd countries tco cap in the french policy debate decarbonization was first introduced in with the adoption of a factor emission reduction target for compared with more recently the discussion on carbon taxation has given rise to several commissions and reports quinet quinet rocard the experts who drafted the quinet report in recommended a carbon tax set at a rate of per ton of co in rising to in as the implicit value of the constraints for reducing co emissions entailed by the targets for and in france was therefore on the verge of adopting a carbon tax for diffuse emissions transport and building that combined with the ets for large industries and electricity would have provided a comprehensive system of economic incentives through carbon prices in all sectors however the constitutional council dismissed the law on the eve of its enforcement while it had already been voted upon by the parliament more recently decarbonization has been an important component of the energy transition which has been set as a priority by president franois hollande to investigate this issue the national debate on energy transition took place in as a deliberative process between different groups of stakeholders ngos trade unions business mps mayors aiming at identifying and assessing the consequences of different scenarios three policy commitments structure the decarbonization scenarios or energy transition trajectories for france european targets to be translated into domestic objectives eu x for targets reduction in eu ghg from levels raising the share of eu energy consumption produced from renewable resources to improvement in the eu s energy efficiency factor reduction of emissions in compared to the reduction of the share of nuclear in power generation down to by target set in by president franois hollande key challenges for the french economy and society that are directly or indirectly related to the purpose of decarbonization include i ii iii iv the rebuild of industrial competitiveness to counterbalance the de industrialization observed over the last years industrys share in the economy has been steadily falling during the last years from in the s to in the s and the million fall of employment in industry the reduction of energy poverty which is has become a crucial issue as in more than of the french population is below the threshold defining fuel poverty expenditures on fuel and heating represent more than of income in particular low income households living mostly in rural areas or in small towns spend on average of their income on energy for housing and transport a long term effort in directing land and urban planning towards more sustainable patterns through ambitious infrastructure deployment this is in particular crucial to control mobility needs in a relatively low density country the highly controversial issue of nuclear energy beyond frances nuclear power plants are on average nearly year old and an intense debate concerns the choice between upgrading them with new nuclear plants extending their service life in some cases or replacing them altogether with other technologies ghg emissions in france amounted to mtcoeq and mtco in excluding lulucf in they were down to mtcoeq and mtco respectively a and decrease lulucf induce negative emissions mtcoeq in and mtcoeq in between and of the ghg emissions are co emissions figure and figure the main sector for ghg emissions is the transport sector with mtcoe representing of ghg emissions and of co emissions excluding lulucf the increase since has been mostly triggered by road transport which represents almost all the emissions from this sector in the passenger transport sector the rise of mobility notably driven by a rise of the distance per capita has been the main source of sectoral emissions increases notably because modal breakdown has remained stable at an share for individual cars energy efficiency improvements have also been significant particularly in the last decade but not sufficient to compensate for the rise of activity levels in the freight transport sector the rise of emissions has been driven by a continuous rise of activity levels indeed demand for freight transport has increased very fast over the period at an even faster rate than gdp and the partial decoupling observed since the economic crisis has only moderated this rise without reversing it the evolution of the modal breakdown has also played an important role in the increase of carbon emissions with a continuous decline of rail share from in to in and the domination of road of freight transport in that were only partially compensated by energy efficiency according to the governments targets rail and water transport modal share has to reach in compared to in the residential and tertiary sector represents of ghg emissions and its increase has been driven by demographic trends and a steady increase in the per capita surface important decarbonization of the energy consumption happened in the s because of the electrification associated with the nuclear program and nowadays electricity is one of the main carriers used for heating which is a french peculiarity energy efficiency improvements developed during the s and have been reinforced between and notably thanks to the implementation of successive thermal regulations for new buildings and to the introduction of fiscal incentives for thermal retrofitting industry represented of ghg emissions in a fall since half of it being due to the drop of industrial production over the last three years the main drivers for the significant decrease in emissions between and are the overall decarbonization of the energy used in industry and further improvements in energy efficiency notably triggered by the european emission trading scheme in particular structural evolutions have gone towards a decrease of energy intensive industries e g and for steel and cement production respectively and technical progress has permitted significant reductions of the co content of production e g the diffusion of electric arc furnace for steel production driving the emission rate from tco t steel in to tco t steel in agriculture represents of total ghg emissions no and methane being major contributors and respectively while co from energy consumption represents only major sources of emissions include land fertilization and enteric fermentation between and ghg emissions have decreased by particularly because of the decrease in mineral fertilizing uses in milk production intensification and in the size of cow livestock france is characterized by low emissions in the power sector because of the contribution of nuclear and hydro energies on average current emissions in the power sector amount to gco kwh this is to be compared with the european average gco kwh however due to the weight of nuclear renewable electricity excluding hydro currently represents only of electricity production the assessment of the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway for france is based on the results obtained with the imaclim france model developed at cired this illustrative deep decarbonization pathway combines an overall ambitious energy efficiency improvement program and a diversification of low carbon energy carriers mobilizing electricity penetration bioenergy and renewables or waste heat table the development indicators and energy service demand drivers in france population millions gdp per capita capita between and economic projections for france anticipate an average annual growth of population is expected to increase by and the structure of the economy is supposed to be for more information on the imaclim modelling platform see http www imaclim centre cired fr lang en stabilized during the next decades the deep efficiency measures would reduce final energy consumption by nearly percent in compared to and electricity although decreasing by in absolute terms sees its share increasing from to in the decrease of the carbon intensity of fuels in end use sectors is allowed by a division by three of coal consumption and even more crucial for the transport sector by a massive substitution of oil by gaseous fuels and biomass on the supply side the decrease of the share of nuclear from in to in and in does not create a rise of carbon emissions because it is accompanied by deep diffusion of renewable electricitymostly hydro wind and pvwhich increases from in to in under this pathway buildings and electricity emissions are deeply decarbonized and the core of emissions remaining in comes from the transport and industry sectors as for transport very important reductions are obtained over the period but given the high initial emission level transport still represents of co emissions industry becomes the second major emission contributor in this is notably because of the assumption of constant structure of the economy which assumes in particular a constant share of energy intensive industries despite the deep electrification of energy consumption electricity demand slightly decreases over as a result of strong efficiency gains in the energy system and a convergence of net exports twh in to zero by power generation technologies are deeply modified over the period towards a diversification of energy carriers with in particular a significant long term decrease in nuclear share in the mix a significant increase of renewable energy in nuclear represents of production while wind photovoltaic and other non hydro renewables produce twh twh and twh respectively due to environmental constraints and in spite of an important technical potential hydro production is considered to remain stable around twh combined cycle gas turbines are needed to ensure both the transition between the decrease of nuclear and the full deployment of renewables and the balancing of the network with high intermittent sources in the long term other energy carriers are also deeply decarbonized thanks to the diffusion of bioenergy in second generation biofuels and biogas represent respectively of liquid fuels and of gas bicycles in the transport sector total passenger mobility is stabilized over the period notably thanks to a limitation of urban sprawling combined with the development of new services for the reduction of mobility remote working and the deployment of a functionality economy car sharing systems which decrease the global demand for mobility particularly at local level in parallel a increase of the modal share of collective transport and soft modes alternatives is permitted by i organizational measures and infrastructure deployment for urban and local mobility and ii new investments in rail infrastructures and the retrofitting of existing rail infrastructures on the technology side motorization types are diversified to adjust to specific mobility segments hybrid electric and full electric vehicles and offer more flexibility in uses range extender and plug in hybrid electric vehicles significant energy efficiency improvements are assumed for cars l km on average for buses for planes a decoupling of freight volumes and economic activity driving a stabilization of freight demand in the medium and long term is obtained through better logistics and the development of eco conception or new technologies such as d printing rail transport reaches of freight transportation in and water transport is developed concerning trucks major evolutions are energy efficiency improvements reaching in and the switch to natural gas more than two thirds of the dwellings that will exist in are already built so that efficiency improvement through the thermal retrofitting of existing buildings is a crucial component of the decarbonization strategy a proactive strategy is necessary to address nearly all existing building retrofitting per year after in the residential sector and mm in the commercial sector and ambitious improvements per unit are considered in the commercial sector and in the residential additionally and consistently with the measures from the grenelle de lenvironnement standards impose new buildings to consume less than kwh m in and to reach zero energy consumption after in parallel the share of multi dwelling buildings should increase inducing only a small increase in the per capita surface electricity and off grid renewables become dominant heating fuels and specific electricity consumption is controlled by a performance improvement for all appliances corresponding to a pervasive penetration of the most energy efficient appliances currently available the illustrative decarbonization pathway considers no major change on the structure of production industry remaining at a constant share in gdp neither on final industrial energy mix the decrease of the carbon intensity being essentially due to the development of biogas and of renewable energy the major breakthrough specific to the industrial sector is a significant reduction of energy consumption which is obtained by the diffusion of optimized industrial processes circular economy and industrial ecology principles combined with energy efficiency gains while low or zero energy solutions may be relatively easily implemented in new buildings the retrofitting of existing buildings will have to be implemented at a very large scale in the range of units per year this will require a combination of technical advancements incremental innovations in the building practices and radical innovations in materials and control instruments capacity building in the industry and specific policy measures to overcome legal and regulatory barriers the transport pathway is supported by a combination of land and urban planning organizational innovations and behavioral changes technological innovation is also decisive to promote smart logistics and support the diffusion of alternative motorization types hybrid electric plug in hybrid electric full electric and natural gas vehicles in particular the development of natural gas vehicles in france could be facilitated by its development in neighboring countries which are already adopting this technology and by the progressive deployment of biogas combined with the decrease in gas consumption for heating in industry technological breakthroughs are not central to the illustrative decarbonization pathway the optimization of industrial practices circular economy and industrial ecology principles is the key option to decouple energy use and carbon emissions from production finally energy production is highly decarbonized essentially thanks to power generation renewables biogas and biofuels the development of all these sources being in line with available assessments of their potentials for tanguy vidalenc after consideration of pre existing energy scenarios from ngos or academic research or public agencies the national debate on energy transition in identified four families of possible pathways sob for sobriety eff for efficiency div for diversity and dec for decarbonization ardity et al each describes contrasted but consistent alternatives for the deep decarbonization of the french energy system along two dividing lines the level of demand and the energy mix between a priority to nuclear to renewables or to a diversified set of energy carriers all these trajectories describe a plausible deep decarbonization pathway since they all reach the factor emission reduction target sob and eff even reach more ambitious reductions of carbon to leave more flexibility on other ghg gases and the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway belongs to the eff family the common features among these four pathways are numerous although each supposes different ambition levels for sector by sector developments and define a set of minimum requirements to reach the factor overall target this concerns in particular in the building sector a deep retrofit of buildings with important efficiency improvements at least units in the residential and mm of commercial surface with an average energy efficiency gains of a phase out of oil product uses for heating and systematic improvements of appliances energy efficiency in the transport sector a switch from individual cars and trucks to rail and collective transport and important efficiency gains in vehicles at least in industry energy efficiency improvements at least and optimization of industrial processes these common features provide a robust identification of the key dimensions of the decarbonization strategies for france however the intensity of some actions driving the pace and ultimate potentials of energy demand reduction and of energy decarbonization in the illustrative pathway may be questioned this concerns particularly the retrofit of the whole building stock by implying annual retrofits the role of biogas as an important combustion fuel the mix of new technologies including biofuels replacing the conventional car electric vehicles hybrid vehicles and ngv and the rapid scaling up as well as high final level for renewable electricity should these targets prove to be too difficult to attain then the decarbonization strategy should integrate the constraints and be adjusted in due time to compensate for weaker reduction in final energy consumption a higher level of decarbonization could be sought with more nuclear and more of other decarbonized sources particularly biomass and waste heat and finally the introduction of carbon capture and storage particularly in industry a div i e diversified mix trajectory would provide such an alternative pathway resorting to less ambitious assumptions on efficiency but still reaching deep emission reductions thanks to more low carbon supply in due time it is worth noting that the a div type trajectory can be considered as a second best pathway in the sense that it is not the most robust given its dependence upon the availability of a vast set of not currently commercially available technological options notably ccs such pathway then offers a solution if it appears that the implementation of an eff type trajectory does not allow to reach the deep decarbonization trajectory because of unexpected barriers and difficulties in mobilizing energy efficiency potentials the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway relies on the assumption of an economic competitive nuclear in the future if this assumption proves to be optimistic for future nuclear development more renewable energies can be mobilized for electricity production reorienting the scenario in a sob type trajectory some technical options are not considered in the illustrative pathway but play a central role in alternative scenarios presented above notably methanation synthetic methane from a recombination of carbon dioxide from fuel combustion hydrogen from renewable electricity heat and a catalyzer can be used as storage capacity in gas network and as a non carbon energy for transportation carbon capture and storage significant storage capacity in the north of france could store mtco year from mainly for industry nuclear cogeneration although a sensitive issue can be used to supply heat for buildings and industry a crucial challenge for the illustrative pathway is associated with the capacity of the agricultural sector to develop an important bio energy supply with second generation biofuels and biogas for energy substitution one of the most important instruments to trigger the necessary changes in technologies and behaviors for the energy transition is the implementation of a price signal through carbon taxation which could be used to lower taxation on labor to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy development or be transferred as a lump sum to households particularly the more vulnerable ones whatever the energy pathway the energy transition would require very large investments amounting to around bn over the period the building retrofitting program only would require between bn and bn each year even if the energy transition will more than compensate the extra investment by decreases in the energy bills of households and industries one of the main barriers to finance the energy transition is the lack of short term profitability of energy transition investments for private agents the difference between private discount rates typically p a or more and social discount rates p a has since a long time been identified everywhere as the major cause of the efficiency gap several proposals for triggering the financing capabilities exist orienting household savings such as saving accounts bn in low carbon investments creating a public bank such as the kfw in germany for the thermal retrofitting of buildings creating an entity for the financing of the energy transition focusing on the retrofitting program and on the development of renewable energies with a guarantee from the state employment has become a very central issue of the energy transition debate quantitative studies of the energy transition in france conclude to a positive assessment with massive job creation potentials in renewable energy construction infrastructures and collective transports new skills will have to be developed for thermal retrofitting for instance at a very large scale and as rapidly as possible on the other hand occupational retraining programs will be needed for jobs in activities such as road freight transport car industry or in nuclear energy with around of active population currently unemployed the acceptability of energy transition is conditioned upon credible answers for professional transitions in these sectors concrete examples of energy transition actions such as building retrofitting optimizing local renewable resources in function of specific uses developing networks for heat or for gas show that concrete actions already happen at local level energy issues are indeed directly linked to many other local policies urban planning local transports wastes housing and also social policies at the urban or municipality levels regional authorities are already in charge of transportation land planning economic development and training participatory processes are also an element of acceptability of energy transition further by empowering local governance systems national policies could leverage existing local experiments accelerate policy responses foster resource mobilization and engage local stakeholders the long term factor objective that became a legal target in is an important catalyst for climate policies by stabilizing expectations of consumers and economic agents in their low carbon investment decisions a medium to long term stability of climate policies is needed although this target has been unopposed by any stakeholder group since its very first introduction by the mission interministrielle pour leffet de serre in some governmental decisions apparently contradictory to official objectives have been observed notably for wind and photovoltaic policies administrative decisions impose new constraints on wind development and since the feed in tariffs for photovoltaic are revised every months as a result wind and pv development have significantly slowed down and the target for renewable energy development in may become unattainable the implementation a pre established increasing carbon price would be central for a full environmental and economic efficiency of public policies ambitious eu and international climate energy objectives are also of paramount importance for numerous reasons leverage effect of eu objectives and induced directives on national policies credibility and acceptability of national policies industrial strategies for low carbon technologies and economic competitiveness issues near term sectoral priorities should focus on renewable energy development and the implementation of the building retrofitting plan these two actions are crucial for any deep decarbonization pathway in france but face strong inertias both because they are associated to long lived infrastructure and require the development of specific skills that are not currently available which make early development crucial in addition these actions have strong potential positive effects on employment that can increase the social and political desirability of these measures in addition specific financing mechanisms must be conceived to support in particular the massive retrofitting program and a carbon price has to be rapidly implemented even at a low level during the first years but with a pre established increasing rate in the range of p a the level of the social discount rate in order to reach a level near to the tco in that has been already identified as consistent with the policy targets ardity m et al quelle trajectoire pour atteindre le mix nergtique en quels types de scnarios possibles horizons et dans le respect des engagements

papua jawa bali nusa tenggara malukujakarta million kmland area million kmmaritime area km coast line provinces cities regencies percent of populationmajor cities and of the generation mix the remaining is provided by hydropower and geothermal indonesia developed with this dependency on fossil fuels in part because of the countrys energy resource endowment which includes billion tons of coal billion barrels of oil and trillion standard cubic feet tscf of natural gas in addition to fossil energy indonesia is also endowed with renewable energy resources including gw of hydro gw of geothermal gw of biomass and solar energy potential of kwh m day indonesia is a developing nation with a gdp of billion us the per capita gdp in was us over the past years the countrys annual economic growth fluctuated between and the indonesian economy has shifted from one that was highly dependent on agriculture to one that is more industry and service based in the composition of the economy was industry service and agriculture it is expected that the indonesian economy will move further toward a service based economy in the future despite continuous economic growth many indonesians are still poor with approximately of the population living below the poverty line in the next three decades the indonesian population is expected to grow at approximately each year and employment for this additional population is critical to lift the population out of poverty the government plans to promote economic growth that averages at least per year and has set a goal of reducing the poverty rate to below by historically energy has not been used efficiently in indonesia because prices were kept artificially low through government subsidies these subsidies have helped fuel an increase in energy use average annual growth of energy consumption has been larger than average annual gdp growth through efficiency measures the government hopes to reverse this trend by it is also expected that remote rural communities will be electrified using local renewable resources such as microhydro power and solar photovoltaic pv technology the government has set a goal that all households will have access to electricity by and plans for energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable energy resources have put indonesia on a deep decarbonization pathway according to the indonesian second national communication which reports the latest official figures concerning the countrys emissions indonesian ghg emissions were around mtcoe in see figure this represents an increase of mtcoe compared to most emissions come from land use change and peat fire and combustion of fossil fuels contributes around of the emissions in the fuel combustion category coal is the major emission source see figure the second major source is oil combustion coal is the main fuel in power generation as well as a major energy source for industrial activities oil is used in the transport and building sectors in the end use sector one half of the direct combustion emissions are from fuel burning in industrial activities emissions from power generation come from the building and industry sectors this is a resource potential based on preliminary resource surveys assuming this could be converted into technical potentials and with capacity factor of then this resource will generate twh per year as comparison in the generation of hydropower was twh many of the hydro resources are located in eastern indonesia far from electric demand center in the west transmission from east to west requires construction of undersea cables source second national communication indonesia as shown in figure the main driver of ghg emissions over the past decade has been economic activity which increased at a rate of to per year increasing energy use per unit of gdp also contributed to the increase in emissions showing that the economy simultaneously grew more energy intensive as a developing nation the indonesian economy and population are projected to grow significantly in the next four decades the projections for these energy service demand drivers and other relevant development indicators are shown in table table development indicators and energy service demand drivers population millions gdp per capita capita access to electricity poverty indicator to achieve significant decarbonization indonesia has to drastically change its energy supply and demand mix see figure the following are the important features of decarbonization in primary energy reduce oil consumption reduce coal share and equip most of the remaining coal plants with ccs increase the share of natural gas and equip a significant fraction of gas plants with ccs significantly increase the share of renewables and begin to use nuclear power the important features of decarbonization in final energy are significantly decrease use of coal increase the share of natural gas significantly reduce oil consumption and significantly increase share of electricity the drastic change of the primary as well as the final energy mix is the result of many measures as shown in figure the illustrative indonesian decarbonization pathway is a combination of energy efficiency low and zero carbon emitting technologies and structural changes in the economy the key elements of the pathway are as follows energy efficiency improvements would be deployed in all sectors the deployment of lower carbon emitting energy sources would be realized in part through fuel switching from coal to gas oil to gas and a switch from onsite fuel combustion to use of electricity the remaining large energy systems that burn fossil fuels would be equipped with ccs technology further fuel switching to renewable resources is a critical component of the scenario in all sectors solar hydro and geothermal for power generation biofuels in transport and biomass biofuels and biogas in industry structural changes in the economy i e decreased role of industry in the formation of national gdp through service sector substitution are expected to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy sector by implementing these strategies the energy related indonesian co emissions will change in a sustainable manner by realizing deep decarbonization by as shown in figure industry and power generation remain the major sources of emissions in significant decarbonization will occur in the power sector from mtco in to mtco in despite decarbonization efforts emissions from industrial sector will continue to increase from mtco in to mtco in as shown in figure land use change and forestry are the main sources of ghg emissions and they will continue to be so without new strategies in these areas therefore these sources have been targeted for reduction as part of the national emissions reduction commitment the emissions from this sector mainly come from deforestation forest degradation and peat emissions a decrease in emissions can be accomplished through six strategies i the acceleration of establishment of a forest management unit fmu in all forest areas to ensure the improvement of forest management ii the introduction of mandatory forest certification systems to reduce illegal logging and increase the application of sustainable management practices iii a reduced dependency on natural forests in meeting wood demands by increasing the use of low carbon stock lands or degraded lands for the development of timber plantation and enhancement of carbon sequestration by increasing forest regeneration and land rehabilitation iv the reduction of forest conversion in meeting land demand for agriculture by increasing the productivity of the existing agricultural land and planting intensity as well as optimizing the cultivation of unproductive lands v a restriction on the use of peat land for agricultural development and the implementation of low emission technologies in peat land and vi the issuance of financing incentive policies and the development of a financing system to support the implementation of the first five strategies the implementation of the above strategies could significantly reduce ghg emissions in these sectors from about tcoe capita about mtcoe in to about tcoe cap about mtcoe in these sources could become a net sink of co emissions by at a rate of about tcoe cap about mtcoe it is assumed that all government targets on wood palm oil and rice production are met the government target for wood production from natural forest will be stable at about million m year starting from and timber plantation will reach million m by the area for palm oil plantation which is now about million ha will increase to million ha by and rice production will meet domestic demand self sufficiency the land demand for settlement and commercial building will increase following the population growth as mentioned above indonesias primary energy mix is currently dominated by fossil fuels oil coal and gas together account for of the energy supply and the remaining comes from renewable energy resources biomass hydropower and geothermal the end users of the energy are the industrial sector transport and building the breakdown of types of energy on the end user side is as follows liquids gas coal and electricity to achieve decarbonization a major transformation will take place in the energy system including the electrification of transport and industry and deployment of renewables and application of ccs another important element of the decarbonization pathway is a significant increase in the share of biofuels in transportation industry and power generation to ensure sustainability the feedstock of biofuels would be planted in unused land without disturbing forest stock and as time progresses and new technology is developed the feedstock will come from waste biomass electricity demand will increase significantly with economic development and a shift of energy use in residential industrial and transport toward electricity in the power sector the decarbonization strategy includes fuel switching to lower carbon emitting fuels coal to gas oil to gas massive deployment of ccs for remaining coal and gas power plants and extensive deployment of renewables solar geothermal hydropower and biofuels deep decarbonization in power generation will also require deployment of nuclear power plants and efficiency improvements in existing power plants a summary of this decarbonization pathway is shown in figure electricity demand will grow per annum on average from twh in to twh in decarbonization in this sector will result in a decrease in the average co emission factor from gco kwh in to gco kwh in and the co emissions of the electricity generation will decrease from mtco in to mtco in to achieve deep decarbonization it is assumed that there would need to be a significant switch from petroleum fuels to biofuels figure b shows the trajectory of the total liquid fuels used in transport industry and power generation and their associated carbon intensity fuel switching to lower carbon fuels and bioenergy solid biomass wastes and biofuels is the dominant strategy for decarbonization in the industrial sector in addition co emission reductions are also realized through industrial efficiency improvement decreasing energy intensity and ccs for coal and gas in heavy industry these decarbonization measures would reduce the emission intensity of fuels in industry sector from tco toe in to tco toe in the trajectory of industrial energy use and the associated emission intensities are shown in figure a a decreased share of industry and heavy industry in the national economy would also contribute to the emission reductions it is expected that the share of industry in gdp will decrease from in to in improvements in efficiency are expected to reduce industrial energy intensity from toe m in to toe m in note carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production the energy demand in the transport sector is expected to increase significantly with economic development and population growth in the passenger transport sector the decarbonization strategy includes modal shift to mass transport electrification of vehicles fuel switching to less carbon emitting fuels oil to gas use of more energy efficient vehicles and extensive use of biofuels similar strategies are also applied to freight transport a shift of freight transport from road to railway is expected to decrease co emissions as a result of modal shift it is expected that the share of personal vehicles decreases from in to in in it is expected that of personal cars are electric vehicles decarbonization of this sector is expected to reduce the emission intensity from tco toe in to tco toe in figure b shows the trajectory of energy use and the associated emission intensities of transport sector decarbonization in the building sector would result primarily from fuel switching from oil to gas lpg and from fuels to electricity along with more efficient electric equipment switching from on site fuel combustion to electricity would reduce direct emissions from buildings and with a decarbonized electricity generation sector this switch would lead to emission reductions for the residential sector increasing per capita income will increase energy consumption but this will be balanced by more efficient equipment and the expectation that homes will remain relatively small the trajectory of buildings energy use is shown in figure c the deep decarbonization of energy activities in indonesia can only be achieved through a combination of measures efficiency fuel switching including to electricity deployment of renewable nuclear and ccs and structural change of the economy especially in the industrial sector the success of the countrys decarbonization pathway is obviously dependent on the realization of many assumptions used in its development indonesian hydropower plants under the illustrative scenario would generate around gw in which is approximately half of the total hydro resources gw indonesian geothermal resources would amount to around gw which supports the gw of geothermal power assumed in the scenario as a tropical country with an average radiation of kwh m day it is reasonable for indonesia to envisage a scenario where gw solar power is used in for energy security reasons indonesia will most likely continue to use its abundant coal resources for electricity generation however most of the plants will be equipped with ccs facilities to capture co and store it in geological formation given the need for deep decarbonization ccs will also be used to reduce emissions from natural gas power plants the total co that would need to be stored by equals about mton with an annual value of mton the storage is assumed to take place in the abandoned and depleted oil and gas reservoirs in indonesia it is estimated that the volume of indonesian depleted reservoirs could store around mton which is more than three times the space required by the ccs scenario deep decarbonization also includes the massive use of biofuels for transport industry and power generation in the total biofuel demand would be around mton per year based on current technological standards to meet this biofuel demand domestically around million ha of land are needed to grow the biofuel feedstock indonesia currently has around million ha of land devoted to crude palm oil cpo production which could be used as biofuel feedstock the additional million ha of land needed to support biofuel for decarbonization would be available from unused non forest land which is estimated to be around million ha power generation is one of the major contributors of co emissions under the current pathway the main tool of decarbonization is coal and gas ccs therefore the uncertainty of the pathway lies in the uncertainty of ccs deployment there is only a limited amount of research into the scale of geological formation for ccs in indonesia the suitability of the ccs scenario is based on the assumption that the co will be injected in depleted gas and oil reservoirs if all of this storage does not become available the alternatives to ccs include more hydropower biomass and solar an increase in the use of hydropower would require the construction of long subsea cables as the location of large hydro resource is in eastern indonesia while the demand center is in western indonesia if half of the ccs envisaged in the illustrative scenario could not be realized hydro would need to be increased from gw to gw and biomass would need to increase from gw to gw the increase in solar power would eventually be constrained by concerns for grid reliability associated with resource intermittency under the illustrative scenario the share of intermittent renewables is only around if the use of hydropower were limited below what is assumed in this scenario solar could be substantially increased before reaching reliability limits which are estimated to occur above a threshold more aggressive efforts to substitute internal combustion engine cars with electric vehicles evs would help further reduce direct emissions in the transportation sector under the illustrative pathway the share of evs in personal cars is in it may be further increased to in also more electrification in the light industry will reduce direct emissions under the current pathway the light duty fleet is evs in this level of electrification could conceivably be increased to the feasibility of this increase however requires further research an increase in electrified transportation and industry will create more emissions in the power sector the low electric emission factor must therefore be maintained as mentioned above additional hydropower and geothermal power could be harnessed to support this increased load to utilize the remaining large hydropower resource it would be necessary to construct a subsea electricity transmission line given that the resource is located far away from the demand center the indonesian illustrative decarbonization pathway is primarily composed of technological changes that are very different from the current mix of energy technologies many of the technologies are still in their infancy e g ccs electric vehicles high efficiency power plants etc the realization of the pathway is highly dependent on the development and maturation of these technologies in the coming years and the technological approach would require massive development of new infrastructure e g infrastructure for enabling mass public transport new railways gas transmission subsea electrical transmissions and ccs facilities as a result one of the main challenges of the pathway is how to finance the infrastructure investment some of the commercially available technologies such as solar biofuel and geothermal power are currently more expensive than conventional fossil fuel technologies wide scale deployment of these low carbon resources would therefore require further technology development to lower costs making them competitive with conventional resources deployment of nuclear power also poses a special challenge social acceptability it is therefore necessary to explore how to convince indonesians that nuclear power is a necessary part of the future energy mix in the indonesian government announced a non binding commitment to reduce its emissions by compared to business as usual development however being a non annex i country concern for climate change is not yet fully internalized in indonesian development agenda to embrace a deep decarbonization pathway the government has to first adopt climate change as a key component of its national development agenda in summary significant efforts are necessary for a deep decarbonization pathway to be realized internalizing climate change into the national agenda financing for investments in infrastructure technology development technology transfer a social campaign for nuclear and the right energy pricing policy for renewables to overcome some of these challenges international cooperation is needed especially for infrastructure financing and technology transfer deep decarbonization is a long term development objective and the incorporation of climate change in the indonesian national agenda has just begun to embrace deep decarbonization indonesia must continue to internalize climate change in the political sphere nevertheless there are a number of near term actions that need to be taken now to begin implementing a decarbonization pathway the modal shift to public transport was initiated decades ago but the success of these efforts has been limited one of the barriers is that investment in public transport has been limited as a result new efforts to explore financing options for the transportation sector are needed biofuels were introduced into the indonesian energy system in however the use of this fuel is currently limited one of the barriers is that biofuels have to compete with subsidized petroleum diesel and gasoline though recently the government has subsidized biofuels increased policies to promote biofuel development are needed currently biofuel production uses traditional feedstocks that are also needed for the food sector i e crude palm oil and molasses research and development into other biofuel feedstocks must be emphasized some technologies that are envisaged in the pathway such as electric vehicles and ccs are new to indonesia research development and demonstration of these technologies needs to be conducted over a number of years in order to make progress the key challenge of deep decarbonization is the financing of low carbon infrastructure the government therefore has to begin to look for international cooperation and find assistance for infrastructure development in addition the government must seek international partners for the technology transfer of technologies necessary for deep decarbonization the japanese economy is characterized by low domestic reserves of fossil fuels which makes it highly dependent upon importations this situation has raised important energy security issues since the s when japan has turned from domestic coal and hydro to imported oil to fuel its fast economic growth after the first oil shock in the s japans energy policy priorities have shifted to be framed around the three pillars of energy security environment protection and economic efficiency with in particular the development of nuclear liquefied natural gas lng and imported coal to limit the dependency on oil the focus on energy security and climate change has favored the development of renewables and the domination of nuclear power which has been the most important energy source until the daiichi nuclear power plant accident in march energy strategies have changed after the accident the innovative strategy for energy and the environment and the comments on basic energy plan by advisory committee for natural resources and energy acnre concluded that the dependency on nuclear power should be decreased consequently the power generation from nuclear power decreased substantially in from its level in and import of fossil fuels especially lng increased in spite of energy efficiency improvement in end use sector to achieve the political ghg mitigation target of reducing emissions compared to the level by with lower nuclear dependence it is utmostly necessary to reduce energy consumption by reducing energy service demands and by increasing the use of energy saving technologies and to increase the share of renewable energies as the potential of renewable energies is unevenly distributed regional electricity exchange is required the major renewable energy capacity is not located in the major electricity demand regions such as kanto area but in the rural regions such as hokkaido and tohoku areas however current electricity interconnection capacity between regions is not high in japan and strengthening interconnections is therefore a crucial issue total ghg emissions in excluding lulucf amounted to mtcoeq in japan of which co represented a large majority mtco or figure a the sectoral decomposition shows that three activities were dominantly responsible for these co emissions at this date figure b power generation notably because the power sector was largely fueled by imported coal and lng even in before nuclear was partly removed from the power generation mix industry because the industrial sector plays a very important role in the japanese economy notably for exports and transport sector because the vehicle transports of both passenger and freight traffic were increased moreover although shares of commercial and residential sectors are not large the emissions from these sectors have increased because of increasing distribution of electrical appliances at the same time the emissions from the industry sector have reduced continuously since and those from the transport sector have reduced since the trends demonstrate a continuous but moderate increase of total co emissions over before recent drastic changes between and after the economic crisis and between and because the closure of nuclear plants after fukushima triggered a temporary increase of fossil importations source greenhouse inventory office of japan saw the most ghg emissions for the to period which was a increase from base year under the kyoto protocol kpby the total ghg emissions in decreased by compared to the emissions in the base year under kpby excluding lulucf since ghg emissions have resumed to increase and accounted for mtcoeq in they increased by compared to kpby during the st commitment period ghg emissions increased by compared to kpby on the other hand if the carbon sink of lulucf and credit of kyoto mechanism are counted the ghg emissions during the st commitment period amount to mtcoeq a decrease from kpby http www gio nies go jp aboutghg nir nir e html in figure the decomposition of drivers of changes in co emission from fuel combustion over demonstrates that the japanese economy has experienced a continuous diffusion of energy efficiency permitting an average annual rate of production energy intensity decrease the other kaya drivers did not have such a consistent effect in that period until growth of gdp per capita has been the major driver of co emission increase while there was a substantial decrease in and due to the global economic recession in and the contribution of improvement of energy efficiency was neutralized by the increase of carbon intensity due mainly to the suspension of nuclear plants after the great east japan earthquake in and the resulting comeback of fossil fuels in line with declining birthrate and growing proportion of elderly people both total and active japanese populations are expected to experience a significant decrease between and by and respectively as shown in table despite the decline in population the continuous rise of gdp per capita is projected to be sufficient to ensure a steady rise of total gdp from about trillion usd in to trillion usd in the deep decarbonization pathways in japan are assessed using aim enduse model table summarizes the major socio economic indicators used in the estimation of deep decarbonization pathways in japan the indicators are taken from the assumption by working group of technology aim enduse model is a dynamic recursive technology selection model for the mid to long term mitigation policy assessment developed by the national institute for environmental studies kyoto university and mizuho information research institute this model has already been applied to assess the mitigation target in japan the model applied for the deep decarbonization pathways is a multi region version of aim enduse model of japan that is to say the model is composed of regions and considers the regional differences in renewable energy potential and energy demand characteristics the regions almost coincide with the business areas of public power supply firms perspective of central environmental council in japan and the estimation of population by national institute of population and social security research table major socio economic indicators variation gdp trillion jpy population million active population million gdp per capita us cap source central environmental council report on measures and policies after in japans illustrative deep decarbonization scenario the long term ghg emission reduction target is achieved by large scale energy demand reduction in end use sector and decarbonization in power generation sector including deployment of ccs in parallel with continuous growth in gdp per capita improvements of both energy efficiency and carbon intensity become the major drivers to substantial co emissions reductions in the mid and long terms total final energy consumption in decreases substantially and accounts for approximately of the level figure right panel particularly in transport sector the pace of energy demand reduction is the most rapid in the mid to long terms followed by residential commercial and industrial sectors the shift to public transport fuel efficiency improvement and efficiency improvement of transportation service will promote the reduction of co emissions in the transportation sector dependency on fossil fuel is reduced substantially compared to the level due to reduction in energy demand and deployment of renewable energy in fossil fuel consumption falls by approximately compared to the level with an approximate decrease of total primary energy supply and increase in share of renewable energy which accounts for approximately including hydropower of total primary energy supply in despite almost complete phase out of nuclear power figure left panel among the fossil fuels natural gas and oil including non energy use exist in while coal is almost phased out because of its high carbon intensity natural gas supply increases in the mid term in place of oil and coal because of its lower carbon intensity but falls to the level by along with energy demand reduction and large scale deployment of renewable energy hence natural gas without ccs acts as a bridge technology the nuclear power is assumed to be phased out gradually see next section for more extensive discussion and electricity generation from coal without ccs is entirely phased out by renewable energy is developed over the mid to long terms and reaches approximately of total electricity generation through large scale deployments of solar pv and wind power figure in addition natural gas equipped with ccs is developed to ensure balancing of the network and reaches about a third of total electricity generation in due to large scale deployment of renewable energy and natural gas equipped with ccs carbon intensity of electricity falls to nearly zero in in approximately mtco is captured by ccs technologies and cumulative captured co reaches about mtco this represents about of the potential of co storage in an anticlinal structure the well and seismic exploration data for japan is estimated by rite the potential storage of co in an anticlinal structure where well and seismic exploration data accounts for about gt in addition the potential storage in existing oil gas fields represents about gt moreover the total potential storage capacity can be gt including the storage in geological structure with stratigraphic trapping etc http www rite or jp english lab geological survey html according to the report by central environmental council in japan it is suggested that about a half of the potential capacity can be economically attractive by http www env go jp council earth r ccs pdf in japanese the industrial sector is the largest emitter its co emissions represent about of total ghg emission in because fuel demand for high temperature heat is hardly replaced by low carbon sources activity levels demonstrate a moderation of activity in energy intensive sectors in line with restructuring of the japanese industry for crude steel production from mt in to mt in and for cement from mt in to mt in combined with energy efficiency this ensures a reduction of final energy consumption by more than fuel switching and notably the phase out of coal without ccs contributes to improve significantly the carbon intensity of energy in the mid to long terms figure a note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production in residential and commercial sectors final energy demand is reduced by approximately in line with a stability of commercial floor space only from mm in to mm in and a decrease of the number of households hence reducing energy service needs in the residential sector it is worth noting that fossil fuels notably gas remain important in the transition until thus explaining a temporary rise of the carbon intensity before electricity becomes the dominant energy over the long term hence ensuring a significant decrease of the carbon intensity in this sector in in the transportation sector co emissions in reduce by almost compared to the level and account for about of japans ghg emissions as shown in figure in a context of a reduction of passenger total mobility of passenger transport demand corresponding to an increase of mobility per person the decoupling of freight transport relative to production is made possible by a combination of energy efficiency electrification of the fleet as well as hydrogen and a small diffusion of gas fueled vehicles for freight reaching in total almost of energy consumed substitute for oil based fuels and ensuring a continuous decrease of the carbon intensity of fuels in figure c a wide range of low carbon technologies is taken into account in japans illustrative scenario and include in electricity supply efficiency improvement of power generation coal and gas with ccs reduced t d transmission distribution line losses wind power solar pv geothermal bioenergy in industry energy efficiency improvement electrification wherever feasible in industrial processes natural gas use ccs for iron making and cement lime fuel economy improvement of agricultural machine bioenergy use nitrogen fertilizer management in buildings improvement of the energy efficiency performance of buildings high efficiency equipment and appliances electric heat pump water heaters energy management system in transport energy efficiency improvement gas powered heavy duty vehicles hdvs vehicle electrification hydrogen vehicles as future availability of nuclear power is still uncertain in japan electricity generation from nuclear plants and availability of nuclear power is based on the premises of new policies scenario of world energy outlook published by international energy agency according to the illustrative scenario nuclear plants lifetime is limited to years for plants built up to and years for all other plants and during to an additional gw nuclear plants capacity is included subject to these assumptions and maximum capacity factor of for all plants electricity generation from nuclear plants represents about twh in complying with previous studies ccs technologies are assumed to be available from and annual co storage volume is assumed to increase up to mtco year in the potential of storage of co is set to be around gtco ccs technology can be applied to both power generation and industrial sectors in the power generation sector both coal plants and natural gas plants can be equipped with ccs technology but bioenergy with ccs beccs is excluded in this analysis for industrial use ccs technologies are available in iron and steel and cement sectors in the amount of captured co in the iron and steel sector and the cement sector reaches about mtco and mtco respectively a maximum capture rate of co by ccs technologies is assumed to be for all ccs technologies in japan as the regions with large potential of renewable energy are different from the ones with large electricity consumption reinforcement of interconnection capacity would be helpful to facilitate more effective use of local renewable sources in the illustrative scenario due to reinforcement of electricity interconnection carbon price to achieve reduction target is reduced by about because power generation from renewable energy in hokkaido and tohoku regions becomes available in tokyo region the largest electricity consumer in japan the capacity of interconnection between tohoku and tokyo region is tripled during to deployment of battery electric vehicle bev heat pump water heater and converting electricity into hydrogen can provide flexibility to electricity system through implementation of demand side management in electricity peak demand in daytime becomes higher relative to off peak demand and this necessitates integration of substantial solar pv into electricity system the illustrative pathway considers a gradual phase out of nuclear but it still represents of electricity generation in and in however no nuclear plant has been in operation since the end of though some nuclear plants have been put under safety inspection by the nuclear regulation authority and it is possible that a complete phase out is decided therefore it is worth considering a pathway that would consider a complete phase out of nuclear to assess robustness of deep decarbonization pathways in this scenario no nuclear plant is assumed to restart in the entire period of estimation after in such an alternative pathway higher carbon intensity is experienced during the transition period where coal and gas without ccs compensates the gap caused by the phase out of nuclear but the impact of nuclear phase out as compared to the illustrative scenario is relatively small in the long term given the small share of nuclear in in any case an emission reduction in is still feasible with additional deployment of renewable energy and natural gas equipped with ccs as the feasibility of deep decarbonization pathways crucially depends on the availability of ccs a limited ccs scenario is prepared to assess further robustness in this scenario co storage volume is limited to mtco year half of the volume assumed in the illustrative scenario and cumulative captured co reach about mtco achieving long term emission reduction target proves to be still feasible with substantial increase of renewable energy particularly solar pv and wind power in the long term electricity supply in place of natural gas equipped with ccs in the scenario the share of renewable energy in electricity supply reaches approximately in and intermittent renewable energies account for about in electricity generation in hence imposing a further challenge for integration into the electricity system the utilization of the technologies that provide the desired flexibility such as pumped hydro plants and demand side management using battery electric vehicles can be helpful to integrate large amount of variable renewable energies vres the following measures should be considered for deeper decarbonization the technologies listed in table are proven energy saving technologies up to on the other hand further improvement in energy efficiency of low carbon technology beyond the levels assumed in the scenario analysis and development of innovative technology provide additional potential to reduce emission especially in the industrial sector in addition system technologies such as reinforcement of electricity interconnection and demand side management system would be helpful for effective deeper decarbonization both in the illustrative scenario and in alternative pathways substantial change in lifestyle and reduction of energy service demand is not considered however behavioral change has further potential to reduce energy demand affordably while maintaining the standard of living for example the material stock in developed countries is likely to saturate and developing countries will also catch up with the developed countries in the future the enhancement of service economy or stock economy will be able to reduce the material demand and as a result energy demand will reduce analyzing these effects could help with more refined assessment of deeper pathways both in the illustrative scenario and in alternative pathways substantial change in material production is not considered however with existing stock level of infrastructure and decline in future population a small amount of material production to maintain the stock level is likely to be sufficient for example stock of steel in developed countries is estimated to be ton per capita if the quantities of material production are controlled the energy service demand in industrial sector could be reduced further and as a result co emissions also could reduce further reduction in emission and energy demand in cities can be achieved by change in urban form favoring even more important shift from private vehicles to public transport and reuse of waste heat in addition mitigation actions in cities often provide multiple co benefits though reinforcement of electricity interconnection is taken into account as an option in the scenario analysis relocation of industrial firms would contribute to more effective use of heat from renewable sources and waste heat especially at present most of the low temperature heat is disposed of though the locations of various industries and locations between industries and residential areas are well organized there is a potential to improve energy efficiency and utilization of heat by reorganizing the locations thereby further reducing co emissions deep decarbonization in japan requires a large scale transformation in the energy system in particular there is a huge challenge to integrate vre such as solar pv and wind power into the electricity system additional plants that can provide flexibility such as pumped hydro storage are built to complement large scale deployment of vres in the scenario analysis in addition demand side management would be an effective option but may not be implemented by a market mechanism alone therefore additional policy instruments such as dynamic pricing of electricity would be needed the pace of deploying low carbon technology is strongly influenced by public acceptance in general higher discount rates provide further opportunity to diffuse low carbon technologies public acceptance of technologies may also involve social issues as well as economic barriers because there are a wide range of possible co benefits and adverse side effects that can be caused by diffusion of low carbon technologies some infrastructures such as power plants and buildings entail considerable lock in risks because the majority of those introduced in the near term would remain in as some gas combined cycle plants as well as coal plants have to be equipped with ccs in newly built plants should be ccs ready in addition to the introduction of the best available technology after the great east japan earthquake in electricity use had been reduced in order to avoid blackouts due to the fukushima accident and the suspension of other damaged power plants continuing these actions could be helpful for deep decarbonization since fossil fuel import values have increased in japan due to the rise in global crude oil price the depreciation of japanese yen and the suspension of nuclear plants immediate actions for deep decarbonization that decrease fossil fuel demand can contribute to reducing the impact on the economy in the near term ghg emissions in mexico are rising due to an increasing use of fossil fuels as the population slowly stabilizes projected to be million by and continued economic growth is expected it is crucial to design a deep decarbonization strategy before new infrastructure is built many actions to mitigate climate change have valuable co benefits local health improvement economic savings and greater productivity among others and some are also linked to poverty reduction and social inclusion for example food and energy security proven reserves of oil in mexico are estimated to be around million tons of oil equivalent toe while gas reserves represent an additional million toe the national energy reform approved recently is expected to boost investments in oil and gas production electricity generation is mainly produced from natural gas oil hydro and coal energy intensive industry accounts for of gdp urban population reached in and it is expected to be close to by around of households have access to electricity to date and there are vehicles per people in some rural areas wood is still used as the main fuel for heating and cooking the majority of future economic growth is expected to be driven by tertiary activities services which could account for nearly of national gdp by in they represented around of the total gdp as this sector is less intensive both in energy and in co than other economic activities in mexico this shift is expected to decrease ghg emissions as gdp per capita increases

information can be gained from an examination of the to time period total energy consumption reached around million toe in including all consumption by final users transport industry buildings energy industries and transmission losses the distribution of final energy use was spread over the following fuels gasoline electricity diesel natural gas lpg and wood approximately of all energy use is dedicated to transportation and close to of that energy is consumed by passenger transport alone this trend reflects the increase in vehicle ownership which doubled from to to approximately vehicles per thousand people this increased ownership and use has caused ghg emissions from the transport sector to increase at an annual rate of between and the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario described in this report has been devised to achieve reductions of co emissions as a result of changes in energy use and production towards less emission intensive alternatives as shown in table this analysis assumes a gdp growth rate of approximately every year from around billion usd at prices in to some billion usd in gdp per capita would reach approximately usd person by table development indicators and energy service demand drivers population millions gdp per capita capita much of projected reduction in co emissions across sectors relies on reducing the carbon intensity of electricity generation coupled with a switch from the combustion of fossil fuels to use of electricity in those final uses of energy where it is possible to do so although some assumptions were made regarding the future energy consumption of some appliances the deep decarbonization scenario modeled does not include the effects of dedicated schemes to accelerate improvement of energy efficiency faster than historical trends non electric fuel switches include a shift to natural gas from petroleum coke coking coal diesel and residual fuel oil used in industry as well as partial use of ethanol natural gas and biodiesel in transport to reduce gasoline and diesel consumption this exploratory deep decarbonization scenario to assumes that primary energy systems in mexico migrate from a heavy dependence on oil to pipeline gas renewables and nuclear power and that end use energy will be provided mainly by electricity and natural gas figure however it is balance nacional de energa sistema de informacin energtica sener official estimates for annual gdp growth in have been recently adjusted from to banco de mxico communiqu http www banxico org mx informacion para la prensa comunicados resultados de encuestas expectativas de los especialistas bbffd ece e bcadb d pdf in this study we assume annual growth as illustrative of a modest constant growth in the long term important to emphasize that a number of factors make it impossible to anticipate what specific technology choices will be made in mexico including the fact that the country is undergoing a major reform of its energy sector which will affect regulation planning and the presence of private sector providers as a result this scenario in no way represents an expected or recommended pathway and is neither government policy nor an official document of planning or intent it merely seeks to lay out what a potential scenario could look like in order to explore possible interplays between technologies and their feasibility considerations this deep decarbonization scenario shows a substantial reduction in the ghg emissions released per unit of energy produced from and figure energy intensity of gdp also decreases at a less aggressive rate of each year to yield an overall reduction of from to finally there is a substantial increase in the share of electricity in final energy use from in to by the scenario assumes drastic reductions in the ghg emissions from electricity generation and transportation and lower reductions in buildings when comparing emission levels from to figure the prominent role of electrification as a decarbonization strategy prioritizes a reduction of ghg emissions intensity in the electricity generation sector in electricity generation was associated with a co emissions intensity of gco per kwh results of an initial analysis show that in order to be consistent with the deep decarbonization objective carbon intensity would need to fall to around gco per kwh by to accomplish this the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario assumes electricity in mexico will be generated from a larger share of renewables especially solar and natural gas with ccs the additional electrical power required to enable the electrification of energy demand is substantial at nearly twh by to meet this electricity generation need the full potential for renewable energy resources identified to date has been taken into account which includes twh year of solar twh year of wind twh year of geothermal twh year of hydro and twh year of biomass assuming that technological advances make it feasible to incorporate high levels of intermittency into the grid by by developing energy storage capabilities for example a balanced mix was composed with the two main energy sources solar and natural gas it is assumed that the rest of the supply is provided by wind hydro geothermal coal oil and nuclear electricity generation from all fossil fuels twh will require ccs in all generation plants gw to comply with the stringent co emission intensity discussed above such a inventario nacional de energas renovables sener in http iner energia gob mx publica version includes estimates for large and small scale hydropower generation mix would have a share of intermittent renewable power of and an average emission factor of only g of co per kwh produced figure under the deep decarbonization scenario illustrated here final energy consumption would amount to approximately million toe by from industry transport and buildings in this exercise the reduction in carbon intensity of the industrial activity is achieved by the massive substitution of oil products residual fuel oil coke and diesel by largely decarbonized electricity to around of energy demand projected by and natural gas the resulting carbon intensity after such measures would be about two thirds less than it is today figure a due to the low energy requirements in households and mexicos relatively mild weather ghg emissions from buildings residential and commercial sectors have not historically been increasing at high rates however steps must be taken to ensure household energy consumption does not emulate north american trends to reduce the building related direct energy emissions the scenario explores the substitution of gas both lpg and natural gas by electricity in final energy uses figure b hydro power is considered as part of intermittent technologies for two reasons highly variable mini hydro in the transport sector a massive fuel shift from gasoline and diesel to electricity and natural gas has been considered as an illustrative decarbonization approach figure c and figure using three exploratory assumptions a passenger modal shift to mass public electric transportation systems to satisfy the increasing travel demand freight shift to electric trains and gas powered trucks and of light vehicles private cars and taxis would switch to electricity and of freight would switch to natural gas and biodiesel by note carbon intensity for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production potential is an important part of future potential and the vulnerability of hydrologic systems to climate change the preliminary deep decarbonization scenario outlined in this report relies heavily on the complementarity between the electrification of energy usage across sectors and the simultaneous abatement of ghg emissions in the power sector in order to do this the implementation of large infrastructure and investments for clean energy are required in this scenario we have emphasized the role of solar energy together with extensive use of ccs techniques at gas power plants achieving this very ambitious solar target twh year assuming a capacity factor of requires an aggressive cost reduction strategy that allows massive roll out of said technology both as dedicated solar power plants feeding the grid as well as distributed production for households and industries and investment in transmission lines further advances in energy storage technology and smart grids will also be required to integrate so much intermittent resource into the grid and would help limit demand on the grid and the need for even more generation and transmission infrastructure given the large share of gas fueled electricity projected in this scenario mexico would need the potential capacity to store approximately million tons of co every year a theoretical storage potential of gtco has been identified in a preliminary study increasing the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources other than solar would require further exploration and technological development to exploit lower yield potentials in wind geothermal and biomass resources the preliminary approach followed to deeply decarbonize the transport sector assumes the feasibility of implementation of extensive electric inter modal mass transport systems for this to be true at the required scale it would be necessary to change the present urban growth patterns todays medium sized cities are expected to drive most of the future growth and would need to adopt and enforce best smart growth practices this scenario also assumed that by electric vehicles will be widely available and that it will be possible to divert freight from the road to electric trains without major technical issues the north american carbon storage atlas nacsa st edition www nacsap org given the dependence of this approach on the decarbonization of the electricity generation sector it is important to explore alternative technological scenarios for this sector in this analysis we assume the presence of competitive energy storage systems that enable grids to include a high share of intermittent sources solar or wind power and are valuable to manage overall demand however if such a solar plan is unfeasible an alternative pathway must be devised perhaps by increasing the share of nuclear power or natural gas with ccs in the from measures considered illustrative deep the projected ghg emissions resulting decarbonization scenario could be further reduced by additional actions that have not been yet evaluated other options that have not been explored at full capacity in the present study and that may have interesting potential are additional renewables wind geothermal and marine power industrial processes redesigned to decrease energy intensity and byproduct ghg emissions large scale ccs in industrial facilities massive adoption of hybrid vehicles large scale production of bio fuels for transport and partially substituting the natural gas in the pipeline network with lower carbon alternatives municipal and agricultural waste can be a source of biogas rather than ghg emissions utilizing biogas from landfills and water treatment operations might help lower future consumption of natural gas for electricity generation major challenges that may deter realization of this scenario include current energy subsidies both for fossil fuels and electricity economic potential lack of resources to fund the transition and the technological availability of cost effective options for ccs electric vehicles solar power harvesting and biofuels production amongst the enabling conditions that require international cooperation we identify technology development for energy storage and energy management smart demand and smart grids carbon taxes to imports and exports of fossil fuels and the development of zero carbon or carbon negative agriculture and forestry techniques to support production of sustainable bioenergy crops and reduce emissions from these sectors although this is an initial exploration of deep decarbonization in mexico some conclusions can be drawn from the magnitude of the challenge at hand adoption of better practices in urbanization and territorial planning could prove crucial to lower future energy consumption per capita and simultaneously improve quality of life better organized cities could induce the behavioral changes needed for mode shifts in transportation a robust low carbon electricity generation policy is required to evaluate different future alternatives increase certainty over governmental plans and provide an economically feasible route for future development energy efficiency programs coupled with appropriate energy price signals could help decrease the financial burden of the transformation needed by reducing energy demand and thus reducing the amount of funds needed to transition towards a deep decarbonization development pathway with the largest territory of the world billion km of which are on permafrost the russian federation has a very low population density person per km it is endowed with large fossil fuel reserves representing of world reserves of natural gas of crude oil and of coal the energy sector is logically dominated by fossils fuels which are importantly used for exports around of the billion tons of coal equivalent tce extracted natural gas coal and crude oil is exported the forest area covers billion hectares most of which is owned by the state the agricultural land occupies mln hectares and is used mainly for plowing crops forage production and livestock pastures the total waste production is approximately billion tons per year less than half of which is utilized or treated national production is structured around industrial production trade services transport and communication agriculture and construction an important characteristic of the industrial sector is the rather high overall depreciation of industrial capital since more than of assets are more than years old across all carbon intensive industries and sectors industrial modernization is one of the high priorities for the national government similarly the overall capacity structure of the power generation sector is quite old as the main investments were made in the s and almost all large units will exceed their expected service life and become obsolete in years notably in out of the gw thermal power and combined heat and power chp plants gw were more than years old and were more that years old another important specificity over recent years is the intense rise of the transportation sector notably for private cars which have reached millions units or cars per people in the long term strategic goals of economic development are stipulated in various official documents such as the concept of socio economic development by energy strategy general http www economy gov ru minec activity sections strategicplanning concept scheme of electricity units allocation and others the specific climate change mitigation policy objectives are provided in the russian climate doctrine presidential decree on greenhouse gas emission reduction and its implementation plan adopted by government as well as the sectoral and industrial plans and programs e g the energy efficiency improvement program environmental policy forestry agricultural and many others the main focus on longer term development goals in russia deals with the economic growth diversification of the economy modernization of its technological base and infrastructure increase of the share of innovative knowledge based sectors improvement of environmental quality and population wellbeing the long term targets for carbon emissions by have not been identified as yet and the deep decarbonization strategy is still to be developed and adopted by russia the structure of domestic energy consumption is centered on fossil fuels where natural gas coal and petroleum represent respectively and of total demand electricity generation is mainly based on thermal power plants of total production and major alternatives include hydropower with and nuclear with the share of renewable sources is negligible below of total primary energy production in russias ghg emissions were dominated by co emissions contributing to of total ghg emissions essentially from fossil fuel combustion which account for mtcoe or of total emissions other major sources of emissions include fugitive emissions from the energy sector mtcoe or and industrial processes mineral products chemical industry metal production production and consumption of halocarbons and sf mtcoe or the agriculture waste solvent and other product use jointly account for mtcoe carbon sinks forestry and land use play an important role in russian carbon balance and are also of high political concern due to perception of the national forest as a source of global ecological gift in the net carbon sequestration in managed forest amounted to mtcoe compensating of total national ghg emissions in this study the main focus is on carbon emissions related to the russian energy sector covering primarily co emissions from electricity generation industries transport buildings and other sources the share of these sources is approximately two thirds of total national emissions figure total ghg emissions in russia decreased by over from to mtcoe figure caused by dramatic drop of industrial production after the collapse of ussr in the period was remarkable for russia as it demonstrated clear decoupling of economic growth and carbon emissions only increase of emission for gdp increase the main drivers of this evolution include economic growth structural changes in the economy technological changes modernization fuel switch from coal to gas growth of energy prices and corresponding energy saving less but still http minenergo gov ru aboutminen energostrategy http minenergo gov ru press min news html http kremlin ru acts http kremlin ru

reforestation forest management etc the illustrative scenario discusses the technical feasibility of a low carbon economic development under assumptions on economic growth notably increase of steel and cement production as well as increase of mobility and patterns of development integrating a set of assumptions from official independent and experts visions and assumptions of russian long term economic development technologies development reviews and projections by the russian and international organizations as well as extensive expert consultations then the scenario of economic development is simulated with technological model ru times with a decarbonization target set up at t of co per capita in uncertainties and robustness of conclusions are discussed in section c table selected assumptions and results about the socio economic and energy sector development for the deep decarbonization scenario in russia population millions gdp per capita constant us the scenario assumes a population decline from to million people in and the almost tripling of per capita gdp the simulation of total primary energy supply tpes and final energy production are shown in figure the deep decarbonization results in a decline of tpes by in with significant changes in the structure of energy production total coal use drops to half of it with ccs natural gas contributes of tpes but almost half of it should use ccs the share of oil should drop to renewables share including biomass rises to and the share of nuclear can reach the final energy consumption from mtoe in to mtoe in in russia should also be significantly transformed in the deep decarbonization scenario coal use to be phased out to the share of gas to reach of tpes liquid fuel to decline to while the share of biomass should reach of tpes and electricity and heat by the scenario pinpoints a decline of energy related co emissions from mt in to mt in the share of renewables in energy balance moves up to in in the decomposition of energy related co emission drivers and its pillars show that the growth of gdp per capita drives co emission up and is offset by the following emissions abating drivers the reduction of the use of primary energy per unit of gdp the energy intensity of gdp must decline from to gj the decarbonization of energy production the carbon intensity of electricity generation should decline from to gco kwh the electrification of the economy the share of electricity in total final energy consumption should increase from to and a declining population concept of the long term socio economic development of russian federation energy strategy industrial and sectoral programs of development electric power sector transport metallurgy and others iea technology perspectives and others the electric power sector is key in the decarbonization of the russian economy electricity itself is a convenient clean energy source that can be produced with zero or very low carbon technologies the russian electric power sector has power and combined heat and power chp plants over mw of capacity the total installed capacity accounts for gw in of which zero emission capacities include gw of hydro and gw of nuclear power plants the rest is covered by natural gas and coal fired power plants the forthcoming retirement made necessary by the obsolescence of the majority of fossil based power stations creates both opportunities and challenges for the industry the modernization will improve energy efficiency of the sector which is far below best available technological options the excessive capacities and slowly growing demand limit opportunities for investment in the industry there are several strategies possible to decarbonize the power industry including growth of nuclear and hydropower already planned by the industry and growth of renewables share in the energy mix however with assumed ccs availability the significant expansion to meet the low carbon target will be required only after the ccs technologies are assumed to be commercially available and they will play an important role in the decarbonization strategy in the power sector in russia beyond almost all remaining thermal power plants coal and natural gas fired need to be equipped with ccs technology by to reach the deep decarbonization target figure it is expected that the recent trends of fast growing mobility demand continues leading to a rise of passenger transportation by and an increase of light duty vehicles ldv and air transport the reasons for this growth include growing gdp per capita expansion of the loan market and a shift from public transport to private light duty vehicles ldvs the low carbon technological options in the ldv sector include liquefied petroleum gas lpg engines in the mid term and expansion of biofuel use in the long run with updating ldv to the best available technologies the electric vehicles will likely meet delayed expansion in russia due to tough cold climate conditions unless the technology improves plug in hybrids with internal combustion engines on lpg or biofuel may be more competitive another challenge is limiting emissions from air transportation which will notably be permitted by the introduction of biofuels the freight transportation rise from bln t km to bln t km in can be decarbonized at relatively low costs the heavy duty vehicles hdvs could use lpg and liquefied natural gas lng in medium term in the long term biofuels would be the primary option the biggest polluter in transport sector will be pipeline transport there seem to be no alternative to the use of natural gas as fuel to transport natural gas via pipelines so the amounts of consumed natural gas will be defined by the domestic natural gas consumption and exports via pipelines with all the decarbonization measures applied emissions of the transport sector in can reach mtcoe figures c in final energy consumption the share of electricity will move up from in to in with fall of oil products from in to and increase of biofuels up to note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production the residential buildings in russia contain huge potential for energy efficiency improvements the heating system in russia is historically highly centralized with around of heat being supplied by district boiler houses and combined heat and power boilers chps the overall depreciation of the heat supply system is over the considered scenario assumes growth of living space area per person from m per capita to m per capita in as a catch up with average living space per person for european countries which is around m per capita the decline of population over however limits the expansion of total residential surface the deep decarbonization pathway requires tapping the existing reserves in energy efficiency improvement of buildings and overall residential heating systems the scenario assumes a drop in energy consumption of buildings by times to the level of kwh per m by this is still a conservative estimate compared to the best practice estimated around kwh m per year the fuel mix structure should also be significantly changed with notable increases in biomass electrification and wide use of geo heat pumps for heating the commercial and residential buildings have to follow the same strategy of energy efficiency growth with additional electrification where possible and reduction of fossil energy consumption figure b shows total energy balance of the residential and commercial sectors consistent with the deep decarbonization target industrial output of energy intensive industries iron and steel non ferrous metals chemicals and petrochemicals mining and cement is assumed to grow up to over the next four decades steel production rises from mt to mt and cement from mt to mt and in other energy intensive industries important energy efficiency gains and changes in the energy mix are then necessary to make this significant growth compatible with limitations of associated emissions the largest energy consumer in industry is integrated iron and steel iis production since the iis industry showed significant energy efficiency improvement that resulted in more than reduction in carbon intensity of steel production due to retrofit and replacement of fixed capital further improvement as expected will lead to additional energy efficiency mainly due to the adoption of blast furnace gas recycling technologies which will increase carbon intensity of the steel production to eu level however for deeper reductions further energy efficiency improvement technologies should be considered such as direct reduced iron dri on natural gas with potential to reduce co emissions up to with decarbonized electricity processes of other energy intensive industries are very diverse and a moderate decarbonization potential of the remaining industries is considered mainly by means of electrification of the industries from to and a energy efficiency growth from to the total fuel mix structure of industry and other remaining sectors agriculture forestry fishing consistent with the deep decarbonization scenario is presented in figure a the land use and forestry sector lulucf is a very important source of carbon emissions and abatement in russia since the net carbon sequestration in lulucf increased up to mtco due to relatively low levels of logging low shares of over matured wood and other factors however the carbon net sink in russian forests is expected to decline and the net sink will become negative emissions will exceed sequestration by the mid s due to an increasing share of over matured forest expansion of forest fires and diseases insufficient adaptation policies and measures etc in order to keep and enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of russian forests as a large source of co absorption from the atmosphere substantial enhancement and strengthening of climate change policy in the forest sector is required including international cooperation in scientific forest monitoring forest fire and disease control measures investment and technological support http unfccc int files national reports annex i natcom submitted natcom application pdf nc rus final pdf the major technological conditions for reaching deep decarbonization in russia include pursue aggressive end use efficiency across all sectors electrify where possible and use gas where not possible to electrify decarbonize the power sector by increasing the use of renewables nuclear hydropower plants and maximize efficiency of thermal power and chp plants methane leakage especially in extraction storage and transportation of natural gas is not covered by the scenario but will require substantial reduction deep decarbonization of industrial production e g metallurgy cement chemicals and other decarbonization of transport sector via electrification biofuel use etc energy efficiency improvement of all type of buildings use of carbon capture and storage ccs utilization of huge biomass fuel potential as well as other renewable energy sources and large scale heat production using heat pumps and energy saving in residential and commercial sectors the most critical technological assumption in the analysis is ccs availability biofuels potential and scope of application of geothermal heat pumps for district heating although ccs has been tested in pilot projects around the world the technology is not commercial yet and it is uncertain if it will be available under competitive costs in russia with significant resources of biomass costs and feasibility of biofuels production depend on many factors including location type of bio resource process of development and competitiveness of the technology in case one of these technological assumptions cannot be realized alternative low carbon strategies should be considered if ccs is not available renewables might be used instead he current scenario is quite conservative for renewable energy in electricity production about in total generation versus other countries where renewable energy may reach more than though russia has relatively lower potential for mainstream solar and wind power there is more than significant potential of tidal and hydro energy a higher share of nuclear power is another alternative electrification of transport can be an alternative to biofuels higher energy efficiency improvements of buildings can reduce demand for heat and geo heat pumps though the discussed scenario already has an ambitious target additional measures could be envisaged to trigger deeper emission reductions notably through further electrification of industry transport final use sectors and energy efficiency improvement in particular under specific conditions to be investigated more precisely the following measures could be envisaged maximizing production of renewable electricity harvesting tidal energy hydro power maximizing energy efficiency of buildings application of ccs in industry including cement and iron and steel combination of biomass energy with ccs hydrogen based technologies where possible including transportation and steel production and optimizing public transportation reducing number of trips switching from private cars to public transport and from air transport to trains the deep decarbonization of russian economy will require significant efforts from government businesses and citizens rearrangement of the national economy in favor of low carbon production technologies and a much less traditional use of fossil fuels will require dramatic changes in strategic planning technological innovations environmental regulation low carbon energy production technologies relevant transport standards and infrastructure household behavioral changes and certainly strong political will evidently russia has an enormous potential for deep decarbonization it has the necessary natural capital and territory technological and scientific potential and financial resources the biggest challenge though is to channel the political will and business efforts towards the deep decarbonization pathway in the current context when the major share of russias industrial capital assets are depreciated and require renovation and modernization it is a great opportunity for starting the new capital investment cycle based on the deep decarbonization platform russia can also play a significant role in exporting clean carbon free energy and products to neighboring countries based on the implementation of large scale projects on tidal energy generation in the north west and far east of russia with unique natural conditions production of the second generation liquid and solid biofuels the competitiveness of the new types of energy will be unlocked by emission reduction targets around the world obviously the international decarbonization regime would play an extremely important role in russias mitigation efforts both in terms of scale and speed of changes required involvement of russia in international initiatives would be crucial including technological cooperation implementation of investment projects e g using russian renewable energy sources new generation nuclear power projects etc global carbon pricing mechanisms forest carbon sequestration and adaptation mechanisms lulucf redd scientific research on low carbon development etc these long term cooperation frameworks need to be provided in the new climate change agreement with active participation of all major emitting countries as well as other international agreements under the un wto and others near term priorities for the russian deep decarbonization pathway should include establishment of the information basis for emission management monitoring verification and reporting on the source level development and introduction of the ghg emission regulation system providing incentives for emission reduction project based cap and trade schemes etc strengthening the current decarbonization efforts gasification programs energy efficiency renewable energy use energy saving decarbonization of transport cement chemical metal production etc enhancing r d in and implementation of breakthrough technologies e g biofuels electrification of transport and infrastructure ccs new generation nuclear power plants etc and improvement of the adaptation mitigation policies and measures in forestry and agriculture supporting carbon sequestration capacities these efforts will allow continuing decoupling gdp growth and ghg emission trends and will facilitate finding new solutions to deep decarbonization in russia partly these measures correspond to the activities approved in the governmental action plan on reduction of ghg emissions adopted on february and other decisions however the deep decarbonization approach will require significant adjustments in strategic planning of the economic development technological and institutional changes aimed at the creation of climate neutral russia the african climate change response white paper dea states south africa is committed to contributing its fair share to global ghg mitigation efforts in order to keep the temperature increase well below c with financial technology and capacity building support this level of effort will enable south africas ghg emissions to peak between and in a range with a lower limit of mtcoeq and upper limits of mtcoeq and mtcoeq for and respectively plateau with a lower limit of mtcoeq and upper limit of mtcoeq for approximately a decade and decline in absolute terms thereafter to a range with lower limit of mtcoeq and upper limit of mtcoeq this is referred to as the peak plateau decline ppd benchmark trajectory south africa has a modern urban economy with an advanced service sector

concern the unemployment rate reaches according to standard definitions when including discouraged work seekers gumede this is the highest rate out of emerging markets tracked by bloomberg bloomberg these issues are acknowledged in key policy documents namely the national development plan ndp and the new growth path ngp and they are highly relevant in economic policies related to ghg emissions mitigation social grants were extended to m people in an increase from m in gumede but relying on grants is not sustainable and substantial socio economic development is required to address poverty

gdp growth of until npc and the ngp states that gdp growth between is necessary south africa a to meet development objectives the shift in the twentieth century of the south african economy from primarily a rural agricultural economy to an urban industrial one was initially based on mining and then transitioned to energy intensive minerals based industrialization with the energy supply primarily based on coal and imported crude oil the structure of the economy has evolved from a tertiary sector accounting for of total gdp in to today there are important linkages between the tertiary sector and the minerals based components of the primary and secondary sectors and the economy relies on the primary and secondary sectors for much foreign direct investment and of foreign exchange export earnings south africas recoverable coal reserves amount to approximately mt giving the country the world s sixth largest coal reserves sacrm and a reserve production ratio of more than years fluri estimates gw of potential for concentrated solar power csp hageman estimates wind potential at gw twh p a there is a large regional hydro potential greater than gw the ndp recognizes that the south african economy is highly energy and mineral resource intensive but states a resource intensive development path is unsustainable npc this is at odds with parts of the industrial policy action plan south african department of trade and industry the beneficiation strategy in the ngp and the current integrated resource plan doe which all envisage strong growth in the resource intensive sectors and labor absorbing industrialization south africa a ghg emissions in were around mtcoeq of which were from fossil fuel combustion amounting to t cap this high level is the combined result of an energy and electricity intensive economy since of electricity is generated from coal and about of liquid fuels are manufactured from coal coal to liquids ctl this would require construction of

prioritizes meeting socio economic development needs in terms of adequate income levels and income distribution and providing energy services for south african residents business and industry this is done while retaining the gdp structure of the economy and configuring an energy supply and end use system that is consistent with the ppd the gdp structure is retained to provide products such as steel and cement crucial for development and to maintain the macro economic stability provided by investments in and foreign exchange contributions of the minerals and industrial sectors these

increase in end use energy required for the illustrative economy with a net decrease in primary energy over and a significant decrease in primary energy per gdp electricity sector emissions reduce radically emissions from buildings halve and emissions from industry increase threefold transport emissions remain relatively constant the other sector in figure which is largely ctl is phased out electricity generation increases threefold electricity generation emissions decrease from g kwh in to g kwh in mainly through the replacement of coal fired generation with csp with storage and construction of significant additional csp nuclear and widespread rooftop pv with south africas solar radiation resource the extensive use of csp with storage and pv across a wide geographic spread combined with some dispatchable generating assets provides a system with satisfactory loss of load probability liquid fuels production emissions intensity is radically reduced through phasing out of ctl and by all liquid fuels are produced locally from crude oil the industrial sector remains a constant proportional contribution to gdp and it significantly expands at some p a along with the rest of gdp which leads to a significant increase in energy demand concurrent decreases in total emissions attributable to industry i e direct and induced emissions are achieved through fuel switching from coal to gas improvements in efficiency of end use technologies and shifting to electricity for some thermal applications supply of significant additional passenger transport from bn p km to bn p km a per capita increase from km cap to km cap meets basic development objectives private vehicle transport increases from km cap to km cap and public transport from km cap to km cap public transport involves a significant shift from mini bus taxi mbt to bus rapid transit brt and rail which are far safer and more comfortable the number of private vehicles doubles from m to m people vehicle to people vehicle passenger transportation achieves a large increase in supply combined with a small decrease from mt mt coeq in emissions through a combination of modal shift and vehicle efficiency improvements the emissions intensity of private transport improves from to gco p km the illustrative ddp has a low level of electric private vehicles but by around of bus rapid transit brt vehicles introduced are electric and compressed natural gas cng powered increasing to by jet air transport emissions nearly double over the period and remain largely un mitigated as standard fossil fuels are used there is no shift to high speed inter city rail more than of freight is carried by heavy commercial vehicles hcv or rail in with export of minerals and beneficiated minerals accounting for thus heavy haulage dominates freight transport demand derives from sectoral gdp growth and related transport requirements and increases from bn t km to bn t km with an increase of pj to pj in energy and mt to mt in emissions the large increase in transport supply combined with the proportionally smaller increase in emissions is achieved mainly through a combination of modal shift and vehicle efficiency improvements a shift from hcv to rail and improvement in hcv fuel economy from to l km all rail is electrified average freight emissions intensities improve from to tco t km note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production if biomass is sustainably harvested and paraffin is replaced with biofuels the liquid fuels and solid biomass components in figure b reduce to zero and the south african building sector contributes a negligible amount to ghg emissions in because all other energy services are supplied with very low carbon electricity of some m households m remain without electricity connections in but tait and winkler show that providing adequate electricity for poor households in the medium term will not contribute significantly to emissions associated with coal fired electricity in comparison with the emissions from other sectors south african climatic conditions allow for provision of adequate energy services with little energy on average kw p a required for home space heating and cooling of water heating currently largest single household energy component accounting for of mid income households can be provided with solar water heaters and with very efficient lighting and electronic technologies that are already commercially available cooking becomes the largest electricity energy service at around kwh p a thus with adequate thermal performance an additional m households could require only some twh p a less than of total demand in the central assumption used in formulating the illustrative ddp for south african is that it is based on known resources and technologies currently deployed commercially although by industrial end use technologies are assumed to improve significantly in efficiency beyond current available levels achieving the required gtcoeq cumulative emissions while maintaining a feasible energy supply to industry as per economic development assumptions requires early retirement of coal fired electricity generation and deployment of low carbon technologies to meet additional demand the specific configuration in the illustrative ddp with csp is one of many very different but equivalently feasible configurations that could provide similar performance south africa has excellent low carbon natural energy resources generic assumptions were made regarding end use technology per major sub sector steady rates of improvement in end use technologies were implemented as were rates for switching from coal to gas technologies with limits for totals this conservative approach has been taken in the absence of detailed plant and end use technology inventories the rates and limits are considered to be conservative for example improvements made in the iron and steel sector which increases its production from mt p a to mt p a from achieve an intensity of mtcoeq mt by this is at the top end of the range of the international benchmark range of tcoeq t switching from coal to gas is an essential component to decarbonize industry although south africa does not currently have significant gas resources or the required capacity for gas importation transmission and distribution it is assumed that it is technically feasible for this to be provided efficiencies across the range of small medium passenger vehicles increase by between from gasoline and diesel vehicles improve from to and to l km respectively and diesel mbt improve from to l km it is assumed that passenger vehicle sales are evs in the central assumption used in formulating the illustrative ddp for south african is that it is based on known resources and technologies deployed at commercial scale the electricity decarbonization relies heavily on csp with storage there is a more than adequate solar resource csp technology is already operating at scale nrel and bids have been accepted by the south african government for supply of a power purchase agreement for the bokpoort mw station with storage which is already under construction thus from a technical point of view csp should be a robust solution however should csp not prove to be viable there are alternative configurations a combination of wind generation solar pv and regional hydro could substitute all or at least most of the csp and additional nuclear could make up the difference see irp documentation doe as mentioned previously assumptions are conservative and should not be a threat to robustness the vehicle efficiencies are robust for example average light vehicle efficiencies assumed in namely and l km for gasoline and diesel vehicles are already available for individual commercial models available today the sales of evs by is a conservative target and hence robust ccs has not been included because south africa has not identified disposal sites despite the considerable efforts that have been devoted to their exploration a government decision has been taken not to pursue ocean storage geological storage is still being investigated and could provide additional reduction potentials notably in the industrial sectors four subsectors account for of direct non electricity induced emissions namely iron and steel other mining and quarrying and chemical and petrochemical cement and glass and paper and pulp raise this to of emissions opportunities for significant deeper cuts that have been quantifiable based on data and knowledge accessible in this phase of the ddpp project mainly exist through improving emissions intensities in the iron and steel subsector and or limiting production of the subsector to local requirements which is viewed as an option in the ddpp approach the ddp includes an iron and steel sector that increases production from mt from with emissions of mtcoeq in i e tcoeq t this can be compared with an international benchmark range of tcoeq t most of these emissions are coal and gas emissions insufficient data has been readily publically accessible in this phase on other industrial subsectors to assess cuts deeper than the ddp improvements are probably possible in cement and glass and paper and pulp but their relatively small contribution made this too minor to consider in this phase associated with providing thermal end use energy substituting the remaining coal with gas technology would achieve tcoeq t i e a reduction of mtcoeq if intensity were decreased from t tcoeq t to t tcoeq t further emissions reductions of some mtcoeq could be achieved reducing emissions to mtcoeq the iron and steel sector exports about a third of its production if this remained similar for production and the sector was limited to providing for local demand another approximately one third of mtcoeq i e mt could be saved the majority of south african energy intensive industrial plants were constructed in an era of very low electricity and coal prices and no ghg emissions constraints it is therefore reasonable that substantial improvements in energy efficiencies and ghg emissions performance similar to those in the iron and steel subsector could be achieved but the lack of readily available or accessible data for other subsectors has not allowed for meaningful estimations in this phase of the ddp project there is a low level of electrification of passenger transport in the illustrative ddp and only conventional fossil based liquid fuels are considered providing opportunities for significantly deeper cuts involving electric vehicles evs and biofuels the large contribution of kerosene combustion emissions for jet transportation also provides a potential deep cut if of evs were introduced by approximately pj of gasoline pj diesel p a would be saved reducing emissions by mtcoeq if biofuels were introduced for of the remaining light passenger vehicles or mtcoeq would be saved if biofuels were substituted for the jet fuel then roughly mt coeq would be saved these ballpark estimates of fuel and technology substitutions save mtcoeq of the mtcoeq of passenger emissions in or some of passenger transport emissions substituting of the diesel used in freight transport with biofuels would save mtcoeq ctl facilities are the core of the largest industrial complex and largest industrial company in south africa phasing out or decarbonisation of ctl thus presents a significant challenge the early retirement of large coal fired electricity generation plants departs radically from official plans doe and requires the construction of considerably more costly csp plants and a large expansion to the transmission network it is unlikely that south africa could cover such major costs without international assistance these estimations are not based on actual south african iron and steel plant performance metrics but on estimations based on public energy consumption data and aggregate projections years ahead and thus are indicative only production capacities in are multiples of capacities and so by most of the plant and equipment will be new and in theory should be able to be at the best end of international benchmarks ranges industries involved in the majority of emissions which are from large facilities are typically owned and operated by multinationals who own and operate world class facilities worldwide the challenge would thus be to get these multinationals to invest in the best emissions class facilities in south africa if industry is to grow at a rate consistent with an economy that can support socio economic development and make an appropriate contribution to achieving the ppd regulations and incentives will have to be put in place to ensure that consistency with the ppd is maintained and that investment remains attractive when the trade offs between cost and reducing emissions intensity are considered the challenge will be to develop and mobilize policy strategic planning finance project implementation and administration to realize the brt and rail projects and to implement complimentary policies in road traffic management to achieve the modal shifts this will require significant development of management and administrative capacity and sourcing of finance avoiding lock in to large emissions intensive energy system assets with long economic lifetimes is crucial emissions from coal fired electricity generation will take up emissions space required by other sectors and maintain a level of emissions in electricity that will cause induced emissions from other sectors to limit their potential to contribute to socio economic development in a carbon constrained world the ppd policy as specified in the climate change response white paper ccrwp needs to be implemented the ccrwp

the economy of gdp dominated by manufacturing which alone represented electricity gas water and construction accounted for and agriculture forestry and fishery made up the remaining this fast industrial development has been driven by the strong growth of exports in they accounted for of gdp the development of industry has also encouraged rapid urbanization with the urbanization rate reaching in manufacturing accounted for of koreas final energy consumption of which energy intensive heavy industries constituted the dominant share of koreas economy is highly dependent on fossil fuels which represent of total primary energy supply given its very low domestic endowment of fossil resources of this fossil fuel demand is met by importation which poses the crucial question of energy security on the other hand renewable energy including wastes and hydro power accounted for only of total primary energy supply due to the limited endowment of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind supply nuclear energy accounted for of total primary energy supply in in under president lee myung bak the korean government launched the national strategy for green growth along with the first year plan for green growth proposing to pursue the following three objectives climate change action and energy independence the creation of new growth engines with investment in green technologies and industries and greening of the national territory transportation and lifestyles while promoting a shift to high value added services over the period to the succeeding government of president park geun hye has launched the nd year plan for green growth proposing to focus on ghg emissions reduction a sustainable energy system and adaptation to climate change net ghg emissions including all sources and sinks were mtco eq in about tons per capita emissions from fuel combustion were mtco eq which corresponded to of total emissions mtco eq excluding sinks and of net emissions figure a electricity generation and industry are the two main activities responsible for energy related carbon emissions figure b net ghg emissions rose during the past twenty years by from mtcoeq to while emissions from fuel combustion increased by from mtcoeq to mtcoeq the key driver of the rapid increase of emissions was a rise in energy consumption due to high economic growth dependent on energy intensive heavy industry that more than offset increases in energy efficiency large increases in electricity emissions reflected a massive shift in final energy demand from oil and gas to electricity due to a relatively low price of electricity made possible by increases in nuclear power supply as well as the low electricity price policy of the government there was also an upturn of carbon intensity during the second half of the s mainly due to an expansion of the coal using iron and steel industries and coal power plants figure koreas population is projected to peak in and to decline thereafter decreasing from million in to million in the economy is projected to grow at the annualized rate of on the average over this period a major uncertainty facing korea is when if at all and how the inter korean unification is likely to occur the present study ignores this contingency altogether with the global benchmark of tons of co emissions per person in the illustrative pathway seeks a very ambitious decarbonization path for the korean economy and reaches an reduction of co emissions from fuel combustion emissions are projected to fall from mtco in to mtco in this is permitted by a drastic decrease of energy consumption in final energy consumption due to large improvements in energy efficiency in addition there are important changes in the fuel mix in particular the importance of oil based fuels which represent one half of final consumption in is significantly reduced and coal use is almost completely phased out over the period figure in parallel electricity and notably of renewable sources develops with an electrification rate of final uses reaching in vs less than in with significant reductions of the carbon intensity of electricity production from to gco kwh figure all sectors are concerned and see their emissions decreasing radically over figure a broad set of low carbon options for electricity generation ccs renewable energy such as wind and solar pv and nuclear power are deployed to permit the deep decarbonization of electricity supply as measured by a fall in the carbon intensity of electricity from to gco kwh ccs is applied to of coal power generation by and all coal without ccs and a share of gas are substituted with renewables specifically wind of electricity production and solar pv of production due to the installation of gw of wind and gw of solar pv residual fossil fuels are substituted with nuclear energy requiring the installation of gw of nuclear power the deployment of renewable energy requires the shift to a large scale distributed renewable electricity system as a result network balancing is likely to be an issue because of the intermittency of renewable energy additional tools such as backup facilities and energy storage should be installed to solve this problem the manufacturing sector was the dominant source of co emissions in with mtco it includes the energy intensive heavy industries and the share of these industries in gdp is projected to increase from in to in this aggregate figure hides a structural change among industrial sub sectors as the share of fabricated metal industries increases while that of other heavy industries such as cement petrochemical and iron and steel decreases manufacturing is almost decarbonized by to mtcco of emissions excluding indirect emission through electricity this occurs through a combination of significant deviations from the current trajectory notably through efficiency improvements resulting in three fold and six fold decreases of energy intensity with respect to the level in light and heavy industries respectively substitution for of fossil fuels in distributed chp in heavy industries deployment of chp to fuel light industries and an increase to and of the shares of electricity in light and heavy industries respectively note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production in the residential buildings sector a reduction of emissions is experienced from mtco in to mtco in the floor space decreases from m person to m person this is permitted by a heavy industries include iron steel petrochemical cement non metallic and fabricated metal industries the last one here includes machinery electronic electric and shipbuilding sectors the share of these industries in gdp is projected to decrease from in to in carbon intensity shown in figure a also excludes indirect emission through electricity consumption combination of the following four broad groups of measures listed in order of the ease of deployment the diffusion of led lighting which substitute for all exiting lighting by higher efficiency of heating and cooling obtained with new technologies substituting fossil fuels in distributed combined heat and power chp which substitute of fossil fuels in distributed chp in mainly with wastes and complementarily with biomass and substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy solar thermal and geo thermal energy substitute of the remaining fossil fuels in the commercial buildings sector includes buildings in business public and agricultural sectors in this sector despite the continuous increase of floor space per capita from m person in to m person in co emissions are reduced by from mtco in to mtco in this is notably permitted by efficiency improvements in heating and cooling waste heat and biomass in distributed chp substituting of fossil fuels in distributed chp in primarily with waste heat and complementarily with biomass and the diffusion of renewable energy substituting of residual fuels in with solar thermal and geo thermal energy the passenger kilometers per person increases from pkm person in to pkm person in the transportation sector however experiences a drastic reduction of co emissions from mtco in to mtco in this is permitted by a major efficiency improvement in fossil fuel vehicles cars trucks and buses biofuel deployment biodiesel representing of the diesel used in deep electrification of the car fleet up to of the stock and the modal shift in both passenger transportation with of passenger cars in substituted with public transport such as urban buses and trains and freight transportation with of road freight in substituted with rail freight such a revolutionary modal shift would require a reorganization of the national transportation system as elaborated in section in the illustrative pathway discussed above the technical options have been introduced based on a consideration of the presumed relative costs or ease of implementing the options as determined through discussions with leading experts from both research institutes and the related business firms with expertise in the individual technology options this has privileged particular efficiency improvements waste energy use and fuel change or new energy resources e g renewable while other solutions face greater technical or public opinion difficulties as detailed more precisely below led in lighting the leds energy saving rate is higher efficiency in heating and cooling in residential and commercial sectors energy savings due to improved insulation are advancements in the efficiency of fossil fuel cars the efficiency improvements of cars excluding buses and buses should be and respectively by being studied by the korea transport institute average saving rate compared to incandescent fluorescent lighting source technology db provided by korea institute of energy research korean technology db korea energy management corporation kemco biodiesel deployment in transport biodiesel is to be blended into diesel for of the diesel used in the existing diesel vehicles can accommodate this option solar pv facilities specification is about gw km the total area allotted to transport roads in korea is about km and gw can be supplied from of this area introduce ccs the ccs capture efficiency will be the storage potential in korea is estimated to not exceed mtco accordingly introduction of ccs for more than will be prohibited by the storage space constraint the illustrative pathway scenario for the power sector depends on renewable energies mostly for emission reduction an alternative scenario depends mainly on ccs introduce ccs for of coal power generation by substitute of gas with renewable energies such as wind and solar pv gw of wind and gw of solar pv should be installed substitute all residual coal without ccs with nuclear energy gw of nuclear power should be installed in this scenario co emission reductions from ccs add up to mtco or of total reduction in the power sector however this amounts to twenty times the domestic storage potential this scenario assumes the availability of foreign storage spaces an assumption that must be examined and confirmed korea could consider another pathway that depends mainly on nuclear power introduce ccs for of coal generation by substitute fossil fuels with renewable energy by installing gw of wind power and gw of solar pv substitute all coal without ccs and gas with nuclear energy gw of nuclear power should be installed in this scenario co emissions reductions from nuclear adds up to mtco or of total reductions in the power sector this scenario assumes that the problem of public acceptance associated with nuclear energy which is currently very serious in korea will be addressed as discussed in the next section korea has one of the highest energy intensities in the oecd largely because of its industrial sector which is dominated by energy intensive heavy industries koreas green growth strategy proposes to ibid a more extensive deployment of this option in korea is expected to be difficult because of the insufficient resource potential for biodiesel according to assessment by relevant korean experts promote a shift of the economic structure toward high value added services the present analysis has not allowed for such policy induced structural changes of the economy high levels of emissions are associated with some production processes notably those of the steel industry posco the leading steel producer is responsible for about of koreas ghg emission they have developed and begun to deploy a new technology called finex which reduces emissions by new and replacement installations of plants over time will allow for the increased deployment of finex leading to even greater reductions in co emissions by there is significant unexplored potential for energy savings and efficiency improvements in all sectors from a reform of the electricity pricing system currently koreas power system operates on an antiquated pricing system which distinguishes several customer groups residential industrial commercial agricultural educational and public and charges different prices set by the government according to economic industrial and social considerations the prices are occasionally adjusted with a major systemic impact on the energy system the current system is biased toward underpricing below the cost of generation and encourages the wasteful consumption of electricity not only by underpricing per se but by more critically by preventing demand response and cost based optimization of electricity consumption by customers more broadly it discourages investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy shifting to a market based pricing system would dramatically transform the energy system by broadening the choice space and deployment potential for various options exploration of these possibilities requires rather extensive study further along this line of analysis over the long term to there is an explosive potential for deep decarbonization from the disruptive convergence of renewable energy energy storage advanced materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes and internet of things involving transformation toward a distributed power generation system the asian super grid proposed by the softbank group of japan should be seriously explored the core idea is to harness mongols enormous endowment of wind and solar energy resources when fully deployed these resources are projected to supply of the global power demand including demand from japan korea china and others and even replace all current nuclear power plants the asian super grid would connect national transmission lines through the existing internet cables and link all major asian cities from the renewable energy power stations in the gobi desert to beijing seoul tokyo shanghai hong kong bangkok even to delhi and mumbai and eventually to the european desertec super grid while direct emission is reduced by it indirectly increases emission by by using more electricity under the current carbon intensity of electricity the st century energy system transformation of energy system through convergence a power point presentation by namsung ahn korea institute energy technology evaluation and planning ketep june proposed by masayoshi sohn chairman of the softbank group on september as he launched the japan renewable energy foundation as a solution to replace the nuclear power system in japan as well as in the rest of asia under the illustrative deep decarbonization scenario presented in this study co emissions from fuel combustion in are reduced by about relative to key challenges for this scenario are summarized as follows considering koreas low energy efficiency relative to value added in energy intensive industries such as steel petrochemicals and cement improvement of the efficiency in these industries would depend innovation and dematerialization of production a modernization of the electricity pricing system would also be necessary to provide the correct price incentives for energy efficiency improvements largely on process substituting of fossil fuel cars with electric vehicles by requires cutting the cost of batteries which essentially depends on international technology actions and building a nationwide charging infrastructure decarbonizing the power sector requires the shift to a large scale distributed renewable electricity system as well as installation of backup facilities gas fired combined cycle etc large energy storages pumping power batteries etc and the deployment of a smart grid to solve the intermittency problem of renewable energy the large modal shift in both passenger and freight transportation to public and rail transportation projected in this study would require a revolutionary reorganization of the national transportation system key to reorganization should be an extensive national high speed rail network with urban and regional rapid mass transportation systems built around l high speed rail stations supplemented with new conveyor belt type rail freight services and double deck freight trains serving main freight transportation routes the current system of explicit and implicit subsidies for freight trucking and urban parking should be withdrawn continued deployment of nuclear power requires a fundamental solution to the widespread concern over its safety and especially over disposal of the spent fuel deployment of the smart model which allows passive cooling would considerably allay the maintenance safety concern by preventing a fukushima type meltdown of the reactor development and deployment of the pyro processing technology for transmutation of high level waste to mid level waste would fundamentally allay the concern over the spent fuel disposal problem by recycling the fuel but it would take one to two decades of international r d cooperation to develop the necessary technology shift to a distributed power generation system will be necessary in order to overcome the not in my back yard nimby problem obstructing the installation of various facilities including the transmission lines according to the japan renewable energy foundation wind power generation in the gobi desert will amount to twh and solar power generation in gobi to twh annually korea is among the countries which boast the highest energy efficiency in these industries when the efficiency is measured against output this technology is being developed by the korea transport institute smart stands for system integrated modular advanced reactor smart was developed by korea in is one tenth mw the size of the existing model mw and would fit distributed power system to be realistic nuclear power and fossil fuel power generation with ccs each offer the largest scope for decarbonization of the energy system to but the problem of disposal of the spent fuel from nuclear power presents one of the most serious obstacles to deploying nuclear power the pyro processing technology if and when it becomes available will essentially solve this problem accordingly korea should urgently enter a joint international research program on the technology with the united states in which korea has a binding agreement on disposal of its spent fuel in the case of ccs the seemingly limited availability of storage space in koreas coastal seas is the main obstacle korea should urgently explore the possibility of entering agreements with suppliers of coal and natural gas such as australia which could allow korea to lease storage spaces improving the energy efficiency in buildings transport and industry offers the largest scope for decarbonization in the near term this requires among other things increases in energy prices including that of electricity carbon pricing of energy in general and market based pricing of electricity correct pricing is necessary and urgent accompanied by strengthening of the appropriate energy efficiency and emission standards the same set of measures would also facilitate development and deployment of renewable energy in korea in particular there seems to be a serious limit to deployment of solar panels because of the large space requirement an alternative should be the installation of bipv on the walls of buildings accordingly development and deployment of bipv should be a high priority as to wind power the objections from local residents or national park authorities to installation of the wind turbines is a serious obstacle to its deployment on land the promising alternative is the ocean wind turbine the development and deployment of this technology is a high priority another high priority plan is the replacement of the current centralized electricity generation system with a distributed electricity generation system including extensive deployment of the smart grid this calls for a systemic reorganization of the national power system a major reform to be carried over a decade or longer the most urgent priority however is to develop and build a national consensus on the long term target for deep decarbonization of the korean economy this would in turn require widespread understanding of the objective conditions for koreas positioning on how to apportion the collective responsibility for global decarbonization among the leading emitters today of the range of the plausible technological pathways as well as their implications for the requisite energy system transformation furthermore such consensus building should be informed by understanding of what the pathways would entail in terms of benefits and costs to the economy and society the present deep decarbonization study conducted as part of an international collaborative project involving main emitters provides an ideal science based platform on which to build such understanding and the needed consensus and koreas green growth strategy provides an ideal organizing framework for studies and debates toward those understanding within the framework of the green growth strategy korea should seriously explore the long term decarbonization potential to build a national consensus on the best pathway as well as the requisite action agenda for green growth during next few years such exploration should be based on a concrete roadmap for development and deployment of the necessary technologies part of the g group of nations the uk is an advanced economy with trade focused in services and a declining manufacturing base over recent decades once a large producer of oil and gas declining reserves have increased import dependency in recent years a large energy infrastructure exists due to the historical reliance on gas for heating and high level of electrification the changing economy and energy system have led to three key energy policy issues emerging over the last years energy security affordability and system decarbonization the case for deep decarbonization of the uk energy system was first made in a landmark report by the royal commission on environmental pollution in which proposed a voluntary reduction in co emissions by recognizing the serious challenge of climate change over the decade that followed the government undertook a number of strategic analyses notably in and which further assessed the techno economic implications of deep decarbonization these strategies and supporting modelling laid the foundation in for the uk to be the first g economy to legislate a long term emission reduction target under the climate change act a ghg reduction target of is to be achieved by relative to levels with a set of year carbon budgets independently proposed and monitored by the committee on climate change ccc the illustrative deep decarbonization pathway scenario described in this chapter reflects both government led and independent analysis undertaken over the past years assessing a range of transition pathways its core focus is on timely emission reductions to ensure that the longer term target objective is not undermined and on delivery of these reductions in the most cost effective way the

so called dash for gas reducing the uks historical reliance on coal figure the other key driver has been economic restructuring with large reductions in emissions from industrial energy use including in iron and steel sector over the period and a general shift to a lower energy intensive economy efficiency gains in end use sectors buildings transport have led to either no growth or small decreases

sector does not increase by in absolute terms due to the large scale reduction in use of oil products which fall from to mtoe by gas while only playing a small role in end use sectors as shown above remains important for power generation in ccs plants and by the sector uses over more than current levels overall gas use decreases by due to its reduced role in heating buildings and industrial

from tonnes in to tonnes in and to tonne in figure highlights the key drivers of emissions and the impact of pillars of decarbonization the switch to lower carbon fuels is a key pillar with carbon

abatement action in power generation plays a critical role in the decarbonization of energy supply by the carbon intensity of generation is less than zero energy efficiency gains are illustrated by a reduction in fec and a reduction in energy intensity of gdp this reflects significant uptake of increasingly efficient technologies particularly in the transport and building sectors by as shown in figure all of these drivers are decreasing at a rate much greater than growing emission drivers including population and gdp per capita table table aggregate indicators under uk illustrative scenario scenario indicators unit population gdp capita millions us capita finally structural and behavioral change play important roles in reducing fec in addition to efficiency gains the reduction in energy

that their share of total emissions in nearly doubles to around this scenario is characterized by early decarbonization of the power sector and a large expansion in capacity to enable electrification of end use sectors to achieve this investment in gw of low carbon capacity in the s is required reducing carbon intensity of generation from a current level of gco kwh to well below gco kwh by by a large expansion in nuclear and gas with ccs and wind is envisaged figure all well within the estimated uk wind and co storage resource potential the overall capacity of the system is expected to increase to more than gw from the level of gw the intensity of carbon generation falls to below zero due to the generation of electricity from biomass with ccs which saves an estimated mtco with over gw of intermittent capacity on the system in there is a continued role for open cycle gas turbine ocgt plant as backup and other grid based and end use sector storage technologies strong growth in passenger and freight transport demands to make deep emission reductions especially challenging passenger demand is driven by population growth and an increase in per capita demand for passenger travel along with a increase in freight transport demand reflect a growing economy and increasing per capita consumption as a result the transport sector accounts for around of energy related emissions in figure in the car vehicle stock action to reduce emissions is first through a strong transition to hybrid vehicles in the s and then to plug in hybrid battery electric vehicles evs in s and beyond by of car passenger travel is met by evs limited penetration of a hydrogen network in specific regions sees hydrogen provide only of demand overall efficiency of road passenger travel

but with a higher share of biodiesel than observed for lighter duty vehicles energy demand in residential buildings is based on projected growth in dwellings of between and rising from to million while constituting a much smaller share of total energy use commercial sector floor space is also projected to grow from to billion m the key mitigation actions in this sector include retrofitting of the existing build stock using a range of different energy efficiency measures near to mid term and decarbonization of heat through electrification heat pumps resistive electric heaters and district heating mid to longer term district heating is primarily supplied via waste heat recovery biomass and gas the scenario suggests a pathway that radically reduces the role of gas for heating in buildings with supply reducing from to bcm by note carbon intensity shown in figure for each sector includes only direct end use emissions and excludes indirect emissions related to electricity or hydrogen production industrial sector emissions fall in part due to a reduction in energy intensity of production which decreases from to toes m this is both due to efficiency gains and ongoing industrial restructuring with a move to higher value production sectors for example in chemicals and shrinking energy intensive production capacity including iron and steel and non ferrous metals the decrease in the carbon intensity of fec table reflects fuel switching to electricity and biomass accounting for about of total fec in and industrial ccs on industrial plants which continue to use gas the decarbonization pathway described relies on a large scale shift to low carbon power generation based on a portfolio of options including nuclear ccs and renewables particularly wind nuclear capacity is gw in implying a build rate of gw year from the date when the first rd generation plant is planned to have been built higher annual build rates for gas ccs capacity of gw will be needed which will be challenging given the technological and ccs infrastructure novelty once demonstrated the uk is well placed to benefit from this emerging technology with significant storage capacity for captured co particularly in the north sea the technical capacity of the uk including continental shelf is estimated to be in the region of billion tonnes sufficient to store a years worth of current emissions from the energy sector wind generation also plays a strong role in this scenario providing almost twh in based on capacity levels of gw which is well within the practical resource potential available of over twh for uk implied build rates of under gw are similar to those being currently observed in the uk the building sector offers strong potential for retrofit to reduce energy use through fabric upgrade in the ccc estimate annual savings of mtco sector emissions are approx mtco key measures include solid and cavity wall insulation loft insulation improved controls and behavioral measures however there is also an important heat replacement effect due to more efficient appliances which increases heating requirement and reduces savings rapid switching to heat pumps

provision and industry the pathway described for the uk is challenging and requires a substantial diffusion of a wide range of mitigation options however it is important to highlight that many other decarbonization pathways are technically feasible and could be delivered under the right conditions a recent uk synthesis study draws out commonality across modelling studies but also highlights the different options that could achieve deep emission reductions particularly in the power sector uncertainty analysis published by the ccc highlights differences in deployment of renewable technologies even when both nuclear and ccs are available shares of renewable generation ranged from to with most solutions in the range of to this highlights the uncertainties even where all options are available and that the illustrative pathway presented here is one of many plausible futures further analysis is being undertaken in the uk to explore other uncertainties in energy system decarbonization and what that means for different pathways what is evident from such analyses is that reductions particularly in the power sector can be achieved by a range of different technologies however the non availability of key technologies such as nuclear and or ccs increases costs substantially and tends to both increase the role of renewables and reduce the role of electrification in the energy system in the transport sector under an alternate pathway hydrogen fuelled vehicles can play an important role as a dominant vehicle technology especially for passenger cars this depends on the cost assumptions of the relative fuel production systems the technology and infrastructure costs and the system wide role for electrification for road freight there is less flexibility due to the limited role for electrification switching to natural gas and hydrogen based vehicles is therefore critical there could also be a stronger role for biofuels across the transport system the penetration of which has been limited in this scenario electrification of heating in buildings has been a strong feature of most modelling analyses undertaken in the uk as gas use rapidly decreases out to alternatives to electricity based heating through heat pumps include increasing use of bioenergy solar thermal and district heating which is a key element of this scenario in summary a significant role for electricity is required in the uk for decarbonization although the extent of its role can be balanced against other options further systematic assessment of robustness of different pathways is needed to better understand what are the key technologies and associated uncertainties that impact deep decarbonization from a uk perspective key issues around pathway robustness include ensuring

investment strategies into the uk power system until international energy workshop demand side reduction recent analysis assessing the impacts of key uncertainties on delivery of decarbonization pathways analysis points to critical assumptions concerning the availability of biomass due to its use for delivering negative emissions in and the price of gas and cost of nuclear in determining the generation mix the prospective role played by demand reduction and other behavioral change measures is also highly uncertain but critical in the mix of demand and supply side responses needed for meeting stringent targets additional reductions beyond those considered in the illustrative pathway significantly increase abatement costs and stretch credibility of technology deployment rates modelling studies have considered more stringent decarbonization levels using scenarios to explore co reductions of below levels is equivalent to tco capita these scenarios are by nature exploratory but do provide some interesting insights in the power sector ccs becomes a less relevant technology due to the residual emissions resulting in larger nuclear and renewable capacities the exception is biomass ccs in one analysis which provides important negative emission credits in the transport sector the share of biofuels increases while all hydrogen production is fully decarbonized in a number of scenarios it is only the increased role of price induced demand response that allows the model to meet the stringent reduction levels the feasibility of this level of reduction is questionable both from a techno economic and political perspective most of these analyses suggest marginal costs of abatement of over us tco or higher by the question is whether this level of mitigation could be incentivized and whether political will could be sustained however it is also worth noting that most modelling studies do not account for radical social change resulting in changing behavior for example there are a range of measures in the transport sector that could lead to radical demand reductions e g modal shift including a move to non motorized transport changes in patterns of living

offshore wind demonstrating cost effective deployment of the first new nuclear reactor in the uk in years at hinkley point c will be critical to increase acceptability on cost grounds as well as broader public acceptability an increased role for renewables particularly wind could lead to increased technical operational challenges due to the higher share of intermittency however analysis suggests that high shares need not materially impact the security of supply given a range of options to address intermittency such as demand response storage and interconnection finally an additional challenge is high infrastructure costs for wind other renewables and co storage much of the resource is offshore and often located in remote areas such as northern scotland decarbonization of heat in buildings will require a radical shift away from piped natural gas and potential decommissioning of the gas distribution system to electrification via heat pumps and or introduction of district heating systems large scale uptake of heat pumps will require householder incentives for switching and a supply chain capacity to be in place there may also need to be significant reinforcement of the electricity distribution system especially with smart metering and two way flows of electricity district heating systems will require a financing mechanism perhaps via local authorities and could run up against public acceptability issues electrification of road passenger cars especially for the of travel demand that is made up of trips of less than miles is a key mitigation option a major

integrated assessment model gcam to develop resource assumptions for domestic biomass use in the u s the scenario results shown here are preliminary the transition to a low carbon energy system involves three principal strategies highly efficient end use of energy in buildings transportation and industry decarbonization of electricity and other fuels and fuel switching of end uses from high carbon to low carbon supplies all three of these strategies must be applied to achieve deep decarbonization as demonstrated in an illustrative deep decarbonization scenario main case table describes the measures by which these strategies were implemented and table shows the quantitative results despite a near doubling of gdp between and u s total final energy consumption declines from to ej the result is a reduction in economic energy intensity mj average annual rates of technical energy efficiency improvement are in residential buildings in commercial buildings in passenger transportation

cumulative change between and and rising gdp per capita are more than offset by reductions in the final energy intensity of gdp and the co intensity of final energy resulting in an reduction in co emissions relative to levels the three largest contributing factors to co reductions figure b are improvements in end use energy efficiency a near total decarbonization of electricity generation and extensive electrification of end uses two additional measures contribute to reductions but are not shown in figure b fuel switching to partially decarbonized pipeline gas and the use of ccs for some large scale industrial gas users primary energy is calculated based on the captured energy method in which electricity generation from nuclear and renewable sources excluding biomass is converted to primary energy at its equivalent energy value with no assumed conversion losses i e kwh generated mj note final energy intensity of gdp is shown as a proxy for end use energy efficiency though structural factors also drive reductions by sector electricity generations share of co emissions falls from in to in figure the remaining electricity emissions are primarily from residual emissions not captured by ccs for natural gas and coal fired generation transportations one third share of emissions rises to of total final emissions by excluding electrified transport as the remaining fossil fuels in the economy are applied to largely to long distance transport end uses including aviation and military use that are difficult to electrify or convert to pipeline gas industrial direct emissions rise from to of total emissions by while the residential and commercial sectors are nearly completely electrified leaving negligible amounts of remaining direct emissions note totals based on modeled data these emissions are larger than epa inventory totals due to minor change in emissions accounting approach for certain sources decarbonization and fuel switching in the main case are described in tables and and illustrated in figure which shows the evolution of final energy supply and demand by sector and fuel type over time electricity becomes the dominant component of final energy supply more than doubling its share due to extensive electrification of end uses across all sectors final electricity consumption increases from ej to ej from twh to over twh most of this

used in freight vehicles is transported over gas pipelines so is included as gas here to meet demand net electricity generation grows by nearly relative to as shown in the middle right panel of figure at the same time a gradual shift in the mix of generation sources results in nearly complete decarbonization of electricity by with a co intensity of gco per kwh gco per gj a reduction from its value the generation mix is a blend of renewables hydro solar wind biomass and geothermal nuclear and fossil fuel coal natural gas with ccs no fossil fuel generation without co removal remains in the system by with of generation from intermittent renewables the combination of gas fired ccs generation and hydropower as well as the use of flexible loads such as smart vehicle charging provide adequate balancing resources for reliability on all time scales despite high levels of electrification across sectors certain end uses remain technically challenging to electrify especially in industry and long distance transportation commercial and freight trucks freight rail shipping where battery electric energy densities appear insufficient for the foreseeable future where technically feasible these end uses are switched from existing fossil fuel supplies coal diesel gasoline and fuel oil to pipeline gas as the preferred combustion fuel including compressed cng and liquefied lng forms pipeline gas refers to fuel carried in existing natural gas pipelines which is partially decarbonized over time using gasified biomass biomass constitutes of the pipeline gas supply by resulting in an emission intensity lower than pure natural gas and more than lower than most petroleum based fuels almost all available biomass in this scenario is converted to gas rather than liquid or solid fuels requiring ej of biomass primary energy slightly less than the ej maximum limit for sustainable biomass energy use assumed in this study this scenario assumes that industry employs ccs on site for approximately one third of the sectors use of pipeline gas the residual combustion fuel the annual co storage requirement for generation and industrial ccs combined is approximately mtco in solid fuels with uncontrolled co emissions are eliminated in this scenario and liquid fuels are dramatically reduced with petroleum product consumption falling by almost from to residual petroleum use is in the transportation sector where it continues to be used in some light duty and transit vehicles civilian aviation and military vehicles and aircraft see figure a c for more detail on decarbonization of

to electricity in most residential and commercial energy use including space and water heating and cooking assumptions are common across all scenarios unless otherwise indicated three additional scenarioshigh renewable high ccs and high nuclearwere developed to demonstrate that multiple strategies and pathways are possible for achieving deep decarbonization in the u s they also illustrate some of the differences between low carbon pathways that policymakers regulators businesses and civic groups must assess on the basis of cost risk public acceptance and other criteria all scenarios result in the elimination of coal without ccs a nearly reduction in petroleum use and natural gas use that ranges from current levels to about below current levels all involve a large expansion of electricity generation and electrification of end uses and expanded use of biomass up to the limits of sustainability table at the same time the scenarios are not drop in substitutes two key choices the low carbon sources of energy used to generate electricity and the amount of biomass allocated to energy supplytend to constrain options for electricity balancing forms of delivered energy and demand side technologies resulting in substantially different energy systems with self consistent packages of technologies for example some scenarios depend on decarbonized pipeline gas and some do not some require co pipeline and storage infrastructure and some do not some require continental scale hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure and some do not the transition pathways for the alternative scenarios are shown in figures a c this scenario is similar to the main case in demand side measures in the residential commercial and transportation sectors it differs significantly in the power sector and industry because ccs is assumed to not be available the power sector is decarbonized using primarily solar and wind generation while maintaining the current share of nuclear power in the u s generation mix balancing on different time scales is accomplished with a combination of flexible loads battery and pumped hydro storage a diverse renewable resource mix and hydro and natural gas generation seasonal balancing is accomplished by overbuilding wind and solar capacity and using periodic over generation to produce hydrogen and synthetic natural gas sng hydrogen is produced up to technical limits on the amount that can be transported in natural gas pipelines and sng is produced from hydrogen thereafter these produced gases in addition to providing system balancing are inserted into the natural gas pipeline system along with sng from biomass in the absence of ccs this partly decarbonized pipeline gas provides a combustion fuel for industry and transportation this scenario is similar to the main case in demand side measures in the residential commercial and industrial sectors but differs significantly in power and transportation the details of this scenario are highly sensitive to assumptions about ccs capture rates and biomass conversion rates to liquid biofuels for co capture rates the upper limit on fossil fuel with ccs as a share of generation mix is about before carbon intensities become too high to achieve decarbonization goals through electrification since ccs is used on site in industry pipeline gas consists entirely of natural gas and biomass is devoted entirely to liquid biofuels in transportation residual fuel requirements beyond electrification are met with a combination of biofuels and hydrogen produced from steam reformed natural gas with ccs this scenario is similar to the main case in demand side measures in the residential and commercial sectors it is very different in other ways being built around production of hydrogen from nuclear generation which is used in fuel cells that become the main prime mover in both light and heavy duty transportation biomass is used both for pipeline gas which is

decarbonization in the u s lie primarily in the realms of cost policy public support and resource limitations two key potential resource limitations requiring further study and sensitivity analysis are biomass availability and co storage capacity cost reductions for many low carbon measures are often a function of market transformation and high volume production but continued r d is also important in many areas two areas of study seem particularly germane to current challenges in low carbon technologies electrochemistry and nanotechnology to develop the chemistries catalysts and physical matrices fundamental to improvements in batteries fuel cells chemical processes and co capture biotechnology and genomics which are fundamental to advances in cellulosic and algal biofuels biomass sng production and biological hydrogen production public support must be unwavering to impel policymakers to implement transformational changes in energy systems over the course of decades public acceptance is also a key variable especially with regard to siting of low carbon infrastructure a high nuclear scenario for example seems very unlikely without aggressive efforts to restore public acceptance of the technology although the results here are preliminary some near term priorities for investment policy and regulatory decision making in the u s are already clear for instance significant improvements in end use energy efficiencyin buildings appliances equipment and vehiclesare critical to deep decarbonization in the u s many types of energy efficiency measures are already cost effective but face barriers to rapid uptake due to well known market failures in these areas continued improvement of codes and standards at both the federal and state level are a proven remedy additionally it is clear that low carbon electricity is the linchpin of deep decarbonization and here too existing state and federal regulatory mechanisms from renewable portfolio to emission performance standards can help hasten the transition given the long lifetimes of generation assets meeting a c target by without stranding assets requires not building new coal generation without ccs

development and international relations iddri research and analysis is conducted by country teams comprised of national research institutions annex from australia brazil canada china european union india indonesia japan mexico russia south africa south korea and the united states collectively the countries represented in the ddpp account for over of global greenhouse gas emissions ddpp also works in partnership with several international organizations research institutions and business associations including the international energy agency iea the deep decarbonization pathway project has four objectives i prepare practical national deep decarbonization pathways to consistent with the c target for each of the countries to help them identify their own cost effective transition path to a low carbon future ii contribute to a positive result of the september rd world leaders climate summit in new york and to a successful conclusion of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc negotiations during the st conference of the parties cop in paris in december by making governments businesses and civil society understand how deep decarbonization can practically be achieved in each country iii provide analytical platforms in each participating country to conduct additional climate policy analyses such work may focus on technology diffusion and innovation policy frameworks financing governance arrangements for implementation etc iv build an on going global network of experts and practitioners by using the pathways prepared as the basis for further work on the implementation of national deep decarbonization strategies and by applying the methodological tools developed to other countries and regions defining features value added meeting the challenges of deep decarbonization to limit global warming below c requires unprecedented problem solving on all fronts technological diffusion and innovation infrastructure building and replacement financing mechanisms and financial regulation policy frameworks institutional arrangements business models consumer behavior etc this problem solving in turn requires the development of practical national deep decarbonization pathways through to which will serve as the basis upon which countries will organize further work on the actual implementation of deep decarbonization strategies the ddpp is building on extensive previous work on decarbonization pathways both at the national and global levels ddpps efforts complement other current projects but are also unique the national decarbonization pathways will be truly deep i e consistent with the c target several studies have been looking at emission reduction trajectories to though in most country specific studies the national emissions reductions are usually not enough to meet the c target implementation of these studies by countries would induce infrastructure and technology lock ins and eventually lead to unsafe levels of ghg emissions globally in the ddpp participants have agreed to use a limited number of criteria and methodologies to define the emissions reduction target for their country including the convergence of per capita and per unit of gdp emissions and other methods taking into account important national circumstances the deep decarbonization pathways will be country specific many global scenarios developed to look at ways to reach the c target are considered unrealistic by country experts because they are based on inaccurate assumptions about technology potentials or are incompatible with other national objectives in the ddpp deep decarbonization pathways are prepared by country teams comprising one or more local research institutions the teams use their in country expert consultations to develop practical pathways from their own national perspective helping to form concrete policy discussions with domestic policy makers and businesses local knowledge and organize the pathway process will be sound and transparent sdsn and iddri lead the coordination unit but all analytical and modelling work is done locally and structural decision with regards to the project are taken jointly by all country teams and partners this approach ensures locally owned tools and results that reflect the specific needs of each country but are part of a globally consistent and coherent approach towards mapping out a c pathway all country teams and partners collaborate frequently on common input parameters a shared framework for producing the outputs and exchanging on technology and other assumptions the national decarbonization pathways will be practical a bottom up technology economic perspective will complement the typical macro economic perspective of computable general equilibrium cge models to lay out in great detail the content of deep decarbonization strategies in a transparent manner supported by off model quantitative and qualitative analysis in the ddpp the national pathways will identify country specific solutions to the challenges of deep decarbonization e g for energy related ghg emissions timeline deliverables the ddpp will publish a first report for the un secretary general ban ki moon on july st to contribute to the preparation of the september rd world leaders climate summit it will include one chapter for each of the countries plus a summary of the key findings showing the key elements of deep decarbonization pathways both globally and for each country the ddpp will also publish a second report for the french presidency of cop in early to provide inputs to the unfccc negotiation process compared to the first this second report will include further elements on the implementation these national deep decarbonization strategies it will provide some recommendations on the policies to be implemented to manage the transition costs of deep decarbonization domestically and on the technology cooperation and policy coordination mechanisms to be put in place to accelerate to process of decarbonization globally current status ddpps inception meeting was organized in seoul and hosted by the korea development institute kdi on october and the

appeal to the member states of the united nations early childhood development the foundation of sustainable human development for and beyond we the undersigned submit this respectful yet urgent call to the member states of the united nations to ensure that early childhood development ecd is an essential component of the new global development framework without the best start in life for all children there is no foundation for sustainable societies young children have the right beyond survival to thrive and contribute to sustainable communities and the workforce over one third of the worlds children under years fail to develop to their full potential due to poverty poor health including hiv aids and malnutrition high levels of family and environmental stress and exposure to violence abuse neglect exploitation disability developmental delays and lack of learning opportunities this has serious human social and economic consequences for our societies and our goal to achieve prosperity inclusive social and economic development and sustainability while significant progress has been made to increase child survival more needs to be done urgently to address this developmental and learning gap for children aged years school drop out is the highest in first grade and most children in poor countries and communities are not able to read by age the sustainable development goals provide a unique opportunity to address this gap building on decades of research showing the lifelong benefits of quality early childhood programs and policies to ensure that a specific focus is placed on the physical mental and emotional development of young children their families and environment what do we want the open working group to do speak out about young children and ecd during owg sessions reference to young children is missing from discussion around the post goals young children have also largely been absent from stakeholder consultation it is up to us to ensure that childrens rights and well being are represented beyond simply child survival growth nutrition and access to pre primary education call for targets that cut across the framework ecd is not a single intervention it is a comprehensive package of interventions covering health education social protection womens empowerment nutrition and security which contributes not only to the well being of children but their families communities and countries further ecd programs offer an opportunity to bring a holistic and integrated approach to sustainable development it will also be important to ensure that targets and indicators are disaggregated by age and years highlight good practice in your country use this opportunity to champion examples of good practice cost effective ecd interventions from your country and explain the benefits of investing early in childrens development public advocacy encourage stakeholder groups and the public in your country to get behind international efforts to draw attention to the benefits of ecd and sign the online global early years petition introduction the uns post sustainable development goals process aims to build on the achievements of the millennium development goals mdgs to eradicate poverty promote inclusive social and economic development and achieve equitable and sustainable access to wealth by all whilst these achievements have been significant across a variety of areas including child survival new developmental challenges have emerged particularly the need to tackle inequality explicitly to eliminate poverty and to achieve sustainable development the evidence across multiple disciplines is clear and compelling investing in young children is the foundation of human and sustainable development current and future development goals will only be met if the global community pays attention to the overall development of our youngest members children years their families and caregivers it is during the prenatal period and in the earliest years of life that a childs brain and body develops most rapidly and lifelong patterns of behaviour evolve not only are ecd programs and interventions one of the most cost effective ways of improving health nutrition and educational outcomes they also empower women reduce violence promote environmental sensitivity and can break the inter generational cycle of poverty and inequality creating more prosperous societies ecd encompasses a number of evidence based strategies include parenting support early detection and intervention to address developmental delays and disabilities child care support and learning targeted health nutrition sanitation and social protection services good quality pre school and transition to good quality primary school crucially ecd interventions are not limited to one government department or ministry they are implemented in partnership with multiple sectors and multiple partners and require government to work across departments for a range of social and economic benefits governments should be encouraged to continue to develop comprehensive policies and programmes and commit budgets to early childhood care and education our global commitment to young children is enshrined in the convention on the right of children crc and reaffirmed in the un secretary generals report on the status of the crc and ecd and the third committee resolution it is an essential part of a rights based approach to human development that promotes equitable and sustainable development creating an environment in which young children and their families can grow up and thrive will help achieve key health outcomes improve learning and earning outcomes promote social justice advance womens rights and gender equality guiding principles the following principles should be applied to guide the future early childhood development agenda why is it important link child survival and child development the international community has made incredible strides in tackling preventable child mortality while this focus should not be lost an effective focus on ecd must ensure children reach their full physical cognitive social and emotional development potential this will enable all children to fulfil their fundamental human rights invest early for greatest returns the evidence is indisputable across a number of disciplines including nutrition health and education investing in the well being of young children has the greatest long term social and economic benefits to countries and communities integrated parenting programs in the years for example have increased earnings and reduced depression and violence raising pre primary enrolment to in low and middle income countries shows benefit cost ratios based on school attainment and earnings benefits alone of between and prioritise the most marginalised ecd benefits all children but a focus on reaching the most vulnerable and marginalised including indigenous people migrants refugees minorities and children with disabilities is essential to securing the greatest development gains disadvantaged children and their families gain the most from quality ecd programs but are the least likely to gain access early childhood development and the open working group priority areas focus area early childhood development poverty eradication building shared prosperity promoting equality any goal on poverty reduction must consider its impact on children and their families ecd policies and programs are one of the most cost effective ways to break the cycle of inter generational poverty and inequality by giving all children particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised access to opportunities such as social protection basic services and thus the best start in life and learning good ecd also includes quality childcare which allows families to pursue decent work sustainable agriculture food security and nutrition malnutrition in all its forms notably stunting and wasting in children under years of age significantly affects a childs ability to fulfil its potential access to good quality combined nutrition and child development programs is key to ensuring the full physical and mental development of children health population dynamics water and sanitation ecd includes action to tackle preventable infant and maternal deaths but also must include consideration of child and mother mental health universal access to reproductive health care good water and sanitation and comprehensive treatment of hiv aids mothers who are physically and mentally healthy are better able to care for their children education and life long learning childrens caregivers and their families need to be supported to create an environment in which children survive and thrive access to quality comprehensive early childhood care early learning opportunities and pre primary provision for all children particularly the most marginalised and disadvantaged is essential for preparing children for school minimising school drop out rates and maximising their future earnings and economic potential adult literacy and lifelong learning opportunities are also important for adults with young children gender equality and womens empowerment womens health and development is inextricably linked to the health and development of young children empowering women and educating girls is key to saving childrens lives and providing access to early health and care interventions for all children also enables women to access services and re enter the workplace sustainable cities and human settlements creating safe and protective neighbourhoods to prevent child abuse and neglect and increasing access to areas for play for young children in cities and urban settlements are essential to the development of children climate change promoting ecd programs can help young children develop awareness about and build skills to protecting and sustaining the environment peaceful and inclusive societies rule of law and capable institutions a focus on programmes to promote quality ecd and support for caregivers reduces violence against women and children and promotes positive approaches to managing childrens behaviour young children as a basis for sustainable development prepared by the thematic group on early childhood development education and transition to work issue brief february children are a common basis for all dimensions of sustainable development no advances in sustainable development will occur in coming decades without multiple generations contributing to societal improvement moreover beyond sheer survival children have a right to thrive develop to their full potential and live in a sustainable world in this statement we present the rationale for putting children at the center of an integrated set of post sustainable development goals many have argued that the challenges presented by sustainable development are integrated goals in the areas of poverty reduction health education sustainable agriculture and energy gender equality and social inclusion and development within planetary boundaries must be tackled together not separately an inter generational vision of societal development must underlie these goals without this vision for the next generation there will be no capacity for nations to actually bring about sustainable development recommendation of the u n sustainable development solutions network for target and indicators on early childhood development target all children under the age of reach their developmental potential through access to quality early childhood development programs and policies indicator proportion of children receiving at least one year of a quality pre primary education program indicator early child development index based on existing unicef and other measures encompassing childrens development across language literacy numeracy physical socio emotional and cognitive development the sdsn also recommends disaggregation by age distinguishing key indicators related to poverty eradication water and sanitation social protection health and the right to development for the ages under one year infants years months pre school age years school age and childbearing age chan m linking child survival and child development for health equity and sustainable development the lancet the link between early childhood development and sustainable development childrens health learning and behavior during the early years are the foundation not only for later school success and completion but also their capacity to participate in community workplace and society young childrens growth and development in addition is profoundly shaped by the opportunities for learning education economic resources and interactions provided by adults whether they encounter these adults in home care service or community contexts a powerful set of neuroscientific and economic evidence over the last years now shows that early childhood is a critical stage of human development the foundations of brain architecture and functioning and subsequent lifelong developmental potential are laid down in the early years in a process that is exquisitely sensitive to external influence early experiences in the home in other care settings and in communities interact with genes to shape the developing nature and quality of the brains architecture the growth and then environmentally based pruning of neuronal systems in the first years support a range of early skills including cognitive early language literacy math social empathy prosocial behaviors persistence attention self regulation and executive function skills the voluntary control of attention and behavior each of these skills measured in early childhood are predictive of school success and completion higher earnings active participation in communities and society and reduced odds of delinquency crime and chronic and non communicable disease later skills in schooling in employment in family life build cumulatively upon these early skills therefore as the nobel prize winning economist james heckman has shown investment in early learning and development results in greater cost savings than investment later in the life cycle the state of the worlds young children despite the well established importance of the early years each year

early childhood on the global agenda toronto ryerson university do not reach their developmental potential in early childhood as indexed by risks such as stunting or exposure to absolute poverty indeed a range of powerful risk factors such as maternal undernutrition lack of recommended breastfeeding lack of access to clean water and sanitation lack of stimulation in the home and lack of learning opportunities in many low and middle income countries lead to this loss of human potential such experiences can get under the skin overwhelming the young bodys stress mechanisms and immune functions these million children thus face high odds of early mortality school failure early pregnancy joblessness and chronic and costly diseases across the lifespan this represents an enormous and perhaps the primary challenge to global sustainable development the evidence on essential early childhood development programs and policies to address the growing challenges of environmental crises poverty and inequality and domestic and armed conflict a transformative approach to early childhood development is required in low middle and high income countries alike ecd services encompassing proven approaches to health education social protection and child protection are some of the most cost effective interventions for a range of long term outcomes important to society including completed schooling higher lifelong earnings and reduced crime these programs begin before birth and include comprehensive family planning complete birth registration and a package of proven health

early childhood development goal implementation approaches to assure that the evidence based programs to support these outcomes also exist to guide nations to ensure maximum results on their investment in young children in addition to these indicators specific to young children it is critically important that indicators tracking the entire range of sustainable development goals be disaggregated by age early childhood primary school age secondary school age the transition to adulthood child bearing age and beyond without this disaggregation progress towards sustainable development for the most vulnerable cannot be measured for example stunting is well established and difficult to reverse by age rates of household poverty are the highest for families with young children and harmful effects of poverty are also largest when experienced in the early years without disaggregation by age of poverty indicators the impact of social protection on the most vulnerable will be unknown similarly efforts to increase gender equality reduce population burdens on the planet provide improved water sources and sanitation and prevent hiv infection all have particularly powerful and long lasting influences between birth and school entry disaggregating indicators by age must therefore distinguish the birth to and to year age periods in addition to primary and secondary school ages the large number of the worlds children starting life at severe risk and experiencing toxic stress threatens all other goals of sustainable development the capacity of a nation to build sustainable systems and infrastructure innovate and invest in technology and grow while reducing impact on the earths resources all depend on a workforce with the skills that are foundational to productivity civic engagement and innovation not pursuing an early childhood development goal moreover would not only compromise achievement of all other sustainable development goals but also

extract sdg indicators preliminary and incomplete suggestions for sdg indicators introduction and context educating children and enabling them to be productive fulfilled individuals who can live life to their full potential is the first responsibility of every society the global education community has long recognized both the inequities that arise from denying children access to high quality education and the slow pace of its spread across the world starting from the world declaration on education for all the united nations system and its member countries have adopted and reiterated their commitment to the goal of universal education for all the millennium declaration recognized this as an unfinished task of the new age asking each country to ensure that by children everywhere boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education this two decade long global effort has yielded real results with access to primary education expanding rapidly across the world during this time enrolment and literacy rates have improved and there has been a gradual movement towards convergence of access mostly between girls and boys but also across linguistic cultural ethnic class and geographic disparities yet the improvement is greatly uneven and we are not even close to being able to provide every child with the quality of education she or he needs to participate effectively in our society as the world moves towards the millennium development goals mdg deadline of and begins to ponder on the next set of global objectives the challenge of enabling every child to access the right to universal quality education remains several inter governmental processes are underway that are helping define the post development agenda many of these efforts reflect wide ranging consultations with civil society organizations in country conversations with policy makers children educationists and political leaders many reflect the experiences of the past five decades of goal setting and global policy discussions around education all have produced valuable insights on the state of education and the immediate priorities of the coming decades a few such efforts are particularly relevant for the goals related to children and young adults the report of the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda called for a global consensus around a single sustainable development agenda with a specific focus on quality education and lifelong learning the report of the global thematic consultation on education has proposed a similar focus on equitable and quality education and lifelong learning the un global education first initiative calls on countries to prioritize putting every child in school to improve quality of learning and to foster global citizenship the sustainable development solutions network sdsn is a collaborative network launched by un secretary general ban ki moon to accelerate practical problem solving for sustainable development and to support the framing of the development objectives for the next two decades this report has been prepared by the thematic group on education as an input to the ongoing global policy dialogue it focuses on how best education interacts with both the challenges and the solutions for sustainable development it offers a departure from some of the other reports by focusing on all children and adults especially in their earliest years like some other reports it emphasizes the need to focus on a broad set of learning outcomes to guide policy design and performance it hopes to inject a sense of urgency in efforts to reach all young people and focuses especially on innovations in learning content delivery channels and quality improvements arguing strongly for well funded high quality educational systems that focus on improved outcomes for children be they in the space of early cognitive and physical development better and more relevant learning or preparedness for work and life making the case education as a fundamental right education is an important right in itself the right to education has been recognised since the universal declaration of human rights in article of the declaration stated that everyone has the right to education education shall be free at least in the elementary and fundamental stages elementary education shall be compulsoryeducation shall be directed to the full development of human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms subsequently the right to education was reiterated in several international conventions such as the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights icescr the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw the convention on the rights of the child crc and the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities today many countries drawing from the international treaties have established the right to education as a basic right within their national constitutions education for sustainable development the sdsn fully supports the rio vision of sustainable development as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions of society economic development including the end of extreme poverty social inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance including peace and security societies the rio outcome document refers to three dimensions of sustainable development economic social and environmental and good governance which is sometimes described as the foundation of sustainable development for simplicity we refer to the four societal objectives as dimensions of sustainable development aim to achieve all four dimensions failures in one area such as environmental sustainability or gender equality can undermine progress in others such as the eradication of poverty poor governance and insecurity can all too easily undermine progress on economic social and environmental objectives dimensions of sustainable development economic development education at all ages is a critical element of achieving sustainable development in all its dimensions a good quality education is the basic weapon to end extreme poverty and its inter generational transmission and long term economic growth depends on an educated and healthy population other aspects of extreme poverty such as improvement in health outcomes are intrinsically linked with behaviour change brought about in large part through public and community education the large number of the worlds children that start life at severe risk over million threatens the global goals of poverty eradication sustainable development and social stability available benefit cost evidence suggests that early childhood development ecd interventions of sufficient quality could reduce that number and thereby contribute substantially to a nations future workforce and its active participation in community and society existing research shows three types of ecd interventions with evidence of cost effectiveness a health interventions shown to reduce maternal and infant mortality b parent directed programs for year olds with a combined focus on breastfeeding complementary feeding and nutrition and early stimulation and responsiveness and c pre primary education parent directed interventions for disadvantaged mothers with at risk children showed evidence of cost effectiveness quality pre primary education in high low and middle income countries is associated with large benefit cost ratios estimated as or larger in recent studies this happens in several ways first investment in ecd programs and policies coordinated across education health and social protection raises the ceiling of developmental potential at the individual community and national levels second because effective ecd requires building the capacity of health education and protection systems and across private and public sectors it can form the basis for integrated approaches to sustainable development there is substantial evidence to show that countries with better educational outcomes have improved demographic and health indicators a higher level of education especially among women has been shown to contribute positively to demographic change it increases the age of marriage and child survival and improves awareness of forms of contraception leading to lower levels of fertility and overall rates of population growth increased levels of education are also linked to improved health outcomes as measured by falls in mortality rates risk reduction of chronic non communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and a fall in morbidity related work days in most studies the effect of improved education on health is the greatest in the low and middle income countries additionally there is a strong inter generational effect of education both in terms of healthier children but also in terms of better educational outcomes for second generation learners dimensions of sustainable development social inclusion education enables children at all ages to learn far more than basic literacies to learn values of civic behaviour social justice global citizenship and skills of critical reasoning innovative thinking interpretation socialization self direction and creativity making them more likely to form communities that are economically and socially inclusive thereby building the social capital for a sustainable future during the consultation processes for the world we want a clear goal that was articulated was for all youth and adults particularly girls and women to have access to post secondary learning opportunities to develop knowledge and skills including technical and vocational that are relevant to work and life and necessary for further learning and forging more just peaceful tolerant and inclusive societies moreover quality ecd services can reduce inequality across many studies the positive impacts of ecd on child outcomes are strongest for the most disadvantaged this suggests that ecd can be an effective approach to reducing social and educational inequality a recent estimate based on data from low and middle income countries indicated that billion in lost productivity was associated with the educational attainment gap for year olds between the richest and poorest quintiles in low income countries these estimates suggest that this attainment gap could be cut in half by increasing pre primary enrolment to i e from the current average of to dimensions of sustainable development environmental sustainability support for learning in early childhood can create participatory processes of children and adults for ecosystem conservation and innovations in care for the environment in all aspects of implementation of ecd programs and policies protecting the natural and cultural diversity of environments can be integrated with curricula standards and practice the future of our planet depends on investments in research to develop new technologies use of renewable energy ways of reducing greenhouse emissions and better management of our forests ecosystems and oceans preparing scientists who can undertake this research and push the frontiers of sustainable scientific inquiry will depend on investments in higher education it is important to highlight the fact that education can assist in the process of shifting the global demand away from resource and energy intensive commodities and toward greener products and technologies sustainable lifestyles and less pollution thinking critically solving problems collaborating and managing risks and uncertainty are core competencies that are critical for employment in a green economy and living together peacefully in a sustainable society moreover since the effects of climate change are already being felt the education sector can also play a critical role in teaching relevant skills for successful climate change adaptation and mitigation teaching and learning these st century skills should integrate environmental education climate change and scientific literacy disaster risk reduction and preparedness and education for sustainable lifestyles and consumption conversely sustainable development policies can play a transformative role in child and human development for example environmental toxins can wreak especially potent damage on life course health in the first years of life when neuronal development is at its most rapid and plasticity or the sensitivity of growth and development to external influence is highest efforts to reduce environmental toxins can benefit growth and development dimensions of sustainable development good governance including peace and security sustainable development is impossible without good governance including peace and security but going far beyond to create a society that governs itself in a transparent rules based manner and where its members have a common understanding of its shared objectives and collectively uphold the rule of law education is a vital element of a strategy to build governance structures that are effective fair and sustainable the empirical experience of developed countries illustrates more clearly what the economic literature is attempting to show investments in large scale public education have nurtured and sustained economic growth and well governed societies the more recent examples of east asia have been widely discussed in the development literature and show the consistent economic and social rewards that east asian countries starting with japan in the late th century and including south korea and more recently china have reaped from an early focus on creating an educated population most of todays education systems are not truly designed to ensure the breadth of learning that will be needed for sustainable development in order for learning to achieve impact on societal sustainability it has to spill over multiple contexts and age groups in this report we present a vision of education that is based on the right of every child parent and adult to access quality learning opportunities across their life span to build a common and better future for their societies a global report card trends across enrolment and completion at different levels of education and pre primary enrolment rates across the developing world are low and scattered map rates are marginally higher for boys as compared to girls with an improvement especially in middle income countries since yet fully of children in low income countries had no access to pre primary education in regionally lacked access in sub saharan africa and in the arab states levels of public spending on pre primary education expressed as a percentage of public spending on education were less than in over of countries with available data in the s as for other indicators of early childhood development available across the majority of the worlds countries there have been notable declines in absolute poverty for children under in the south asia east asia and latin america caribbean regions with some exceptions but declines have been much smaller since the s in other regions the highest rates of young child absolute

usual mean what does a shift from a business as usual bau scenario mean there are three different ways of thinking about shifting away from business as usual first in its most literal sense business as usual draft not for circulati on would imply a scenario where countries continue with historical policies investments and programs that lead to incremental changes in overall outcomes of access and quality the first shift from business as usual would therefore imply a break from historical trends and norms this was the scenario that the millennium development goals aimed to bring about by urging countries to accelerate progress in access and completion of primary education this first shift from bau focused mainly on primary education and the challenges of creating an inclusive publicly funded high quality education system that brought all children into the schooling system as the previous section showed over two decades of effort in this direction has yielded significant improvements in enrolment and completion yet several of the original challenges remain public education systems remain severely underfunded in many countries making it impossible to make the basic investments in infrastructure teachers and learning materials that are needed millions of children still remain outside of the schooling system in many countries as the previous section maps show completion and transition to post primary education remains very low the first path away from business as usual therefore will require completing with a renewed focus the promise of universal primary education the second related shift away from business as usual will need to focus on the quality and reach of the overall education system most countries have equated the opening of schools and appointing of teachers with ensuring access yet the agenda of universal access is not complete until learning occurs universally at the primary level this means a much stronger emphasis on what children are learning from teachers and peers in classrooms evidence shows that national learning indicators move slowly even in relatively high performing countries this requires not just ensuring that children are physically in school but focusing on the way teachers are trained the content of the curriculum and learning materials that students are expected to learn and the pedagogical tools teachers employ to help children achieve learning outcomes at the post primary level children in many low and middle income countries are not able to complete a full course of basic and secondary education and reach a level of learning where they are ready to enter tertiary education access to secondary education is also much poorer in much of south asia and sub saharan africa enrolment rates are less than percent secondary education is much more expensive than primary required investments per child are estimated at two to three times those at the primary the level of training of teachers and the quality of infrastructure is also much higher and more specialized the tertiary education system is out of bounds for most children in developing countries today it is extremely difficult to compare learning outcomes of educational systems across draft not for circulati on countries there are very few globally comparable standards or tests that allow for such comparisons the partial evidence that does exist through cross country standardized tests such as pisa show large variations within and between countries the limited data that does exist does not project an optimistic picture current trends indicate that over half of developing countries with learning data from standardized tests such as pisa would take over years to achieve oecd learning levels in the case of selected sub saharan african countries reaching oecd levels would take over years table the six efa goals highlighted the pathways for exactly such a shift towards comprehensive quality education across all level of the system table catching up to oecd levels for pisa and sacmeq tests selected countries draft not for circulati on modified and reproduced from beatty and pritchett this second shift away from business as usual would therefore require two components a focus on improving learning at the primary level and learning from the experience of primary expansion to think about post primary expansion in a way that combines the twin objectives of learning and access but as we saw in chapter even if these two shifts from business as usual occurred they would not necessarily create an education system that prepared children and young adults for the world that we are entering into the challenges of sustainable development require a population that is trained not just in basic numeracy and literacy but in advanced cognitive skills in analytical skills and in social cultural civic and emotional skills it requires a population that invests in children at birth long before pisa scores improvement

to the needs of a sustainable society and it requires a society that regularly upgrades and reinvests in its own people at all ages to build new competencies table shows that even economically prosperous countries today are not entirely ready for these challenges while education systems respond to the challenges of primary secondary and tertiary access and learning they do not respond systematically to the need to prepare young infants for life or prepare young adolescents and adults for work or citizenship or adults for lifelong learning some of these new challenges can be addressed through existing structures but some will require innovations in design and delivery models table the business as usual scenario draft not for circulati on region earlychildhooddevelopment

lay out the emerging challenges that countries will face over the next fifteen years we argue that they require a much broader and faster set of actions than in the past and will need for educationists policy makers civil society parents and communities to come together build a sustainable future upcoming challenges the scale and scope of problems despite the diversity in cultural and economic contexts education systems across the world have followed a remarkably similar structure for the last centuries they open their doors to children between the ages of and years adopt similar systems designed to transfer knowledge across subjects spanning language arithmetic basic sciences and social studies for the next years this knowledge is transferred from the teachers to students through a similar set of pedagogical tools in classroom groupings ranging from to over students teachers are identified through pen and paper exams and trained to have subject matter knowledge and pedagogical expertise to varying degrees in most countries teachers are also de facto role models for young children introducing them to norms of social and cultural behaviour and values schools provide safe havens to children for hours a day where they are sorted by age and are exposed to academic studies to sports and to varying degrees social skill building activities standardized exams at the end of the schooling cycle draft not for circulati on then test children for their knowledge and preparation for higher education tertiary systems of education are also remarkably similar students either prepare for professional degrees or liberal arts and natural sciences or vocational skills not available everywhere that sort them for the occupational specializations of a post agricultural largely industrial society this description though crude approximates reality across countries in the world today it underlines the greatest purported value of education systems the offer of a level playing field and the promise of social and economic mobility they help create a large pool of labour with common skills they have proven to be resilient and effective ways of bringing in massive numbers of children from diverse backgrounds together for a common socialization process these systems have been replicated across the world starting from a base in northern europe in the s and today form a mostly unquestioned core edifice of society today over billion children are enrolled in formal systems of schooling worldwide the largest number and the highest proportion of children ever in the history of humankind the differences across education systems in different countries are also significant the first difference is that of resources estimates show that countries in north america and western europe spent approximately us per pupil as compared to us per pupil in south and west asia and us per pupil in sub saharan africa in primary education in ppp adjusted constant prices the second difference is in the way teachers are identified trained supported and treated by their employers their community and the parents of the children they teach finally there are significant differences in how curricula are designed how learning is assessed and how standards are determined and maintained all of these differences explain to varying degrees the wide variation in educational outcomes across countries looking forward towards the next fifteen years there are four societal changes that can affect education systems first a growing young population in much of the arab world south asia and sub saharan africa among other regions is a challenge when coupled with growing aspirations of the population that is more literate and getting increasingly familiar with economic growth not only will more children need more primary schools but as they complete primary education there will be much greater demand for secondary vocational and tertiary education second in most parts of the world people are becoming more mobile and urban higher rates of mobility are becoming the norm not only within countries but also across countries this means that planning for educational expansion will require taking into account forecasts of rapidly shifting populations and differential shifting rates by demographic structures draft not for circulati on third the old definitions of literacy of simple ability to read and count are no more sufficient of course there is enough evidence from different parts of the world that indicate that even this basic literacy is not imparted effectively but going beyond basic numeracy and literacy there are several other types of basic literacies that are critical digital literacy and financial literacy are becoming essential to participate in globalizing economies health and safety hazards come in many forms now not only in public places but at home too science literacy and math literacy are a growing need for all ages fourth technology is changing our individual and collective lives dramatically in all its aspects economic political and social to varying degrees around the world the communication revolution has created immense possibilities but it is also throwing challenges of making judicious choices in a deluge of information as degrees of individual freedom grow it is important to learn to become individually and collectively responsible for sustainable growth at all levels of human society information and communication technology can be an important ally in expanding access and improving quality however to equate this with merely placing computers in classrooms will be a grave error the essence of the ict revolution is that it allows free flow of information and knowledge which is also characterized by random access to it as more and more children adults and parents seek access to the massive human collection of knowledge we need to consider systemic barriers to access to knowledge and how the population especially in the developing world can be enabled to overcome these barriers the world of education is already experimenting with new tools such as online learning flip classrooms and moocs for now this is largely in the domain of the more academic sphere of learning in the developing world there is relatively little understanding of the ways in which technology can serve to improve educational outcomes in practical and immediate ways finally as we work towards creating sustainable development goals the complex web of problems that will need resolution will require skills knowledge and contributions that exceed the current capacities of most education systems both in the developed and developing worlds in the next section we highlight the four broad challenges that emerge from the societal shifts described above figure they reflect both the unfulfilled agenda of the millennium development goals and the new responsibilities of creating global citizens that can continually participate in learning figure schema of emerging challenges draft not for circulati on continuing inequalities of access and participation over the last few decades despite expansion education systems have not been able to reach out to the most marginalized and vulnerable children who in fact are likely to be their biggest beneficiaries children do not enter the schooling system on an equal footing their gender social and political environments family background and income levels location and access to schools and ethnicity all play a role in determining not just access but also how well they are able to learn and cope in formal emergingchallengesproviding universal access to quality basic educationopportunities of ictdisruptive possibilitieschanging role

demographics schools in many countries education systems are systematically under funded making it difficult for them to garner the additional resources needed to reach every girl and boy and retain them in school girls face systemic challenges evidence shows that despite recent progress gender matters immensely in most developing countries girls face significant domestic responsibilities ranging from caring for siblings and sick relatives to collecting firewood and water often requiring several hours of walking a day to helping in domestic tasks of cooking and cleaning leaving them with much less time to attend school even if attendance is high at the primary level once girls reach puberty schools often cease to be safe places for them separate toilets access to sanitary towels and safe routes to and from school are largely absent parents are much more reluctant to send girls to school through their adolescent years consequently girls are systematically less likely to continue on to secondary school than boys in the enrolment ratio of girls to boys was at the primary level compared to at the secondary level in sub saharan africa for south and west asia the girls to boys enrolment ratio was at the primary level compared to at the secondary level children in conflict settings face huge disruptions in access to schooling of the million out of school children nearly half million live in conflict or post conflict situations draft not for circulati on where they face multiple barriers apart from lack of access they face physical danger in their quest for education psychological damage from proximity to and often forced participation in violence affects cognitive and emotional development and the uncertainty of war disrupts education even when it is available leading to interrupted learning on average the primary enrolment rate falls by while the secondary enrolment rate falls by in countries that face conflict children in post conflict and fragile states need special attention and resources the state education systems in these countries do not have the resources to create these additional facilities for example regular counselling remedial programs for children who have missed school etc access to education is harder in rural areas physical location matters children that do not have a school in proximity to their homes or do not have safe transportation paths are often unable to attend with regularity twice as many children in rural areas are likely to be out of school than children in urban areas and adult literacy rates are significantly lower in rural areas as compared to urban areas figures figure adult literacy years by urban and rural populations for selected countries children from poor and socially discriminated backgrounds are the hardest to reach low family socio economic conditions are the greatest barrier to access four times as many children from the poorest income quintile are likely to be out of school as compared to those in the top quintile figure this is for several reasons the most direct link is with affordability in the absence of free schooling parents struggle to afford to send their children to school financial vulnerability also increases the risk of drop out and the ability of formal systems to bring back children who may temporarily have to leave for part of the school year for example during harvest times or seasonally for draft not for circulati on nomadic populations parents of children from low income homes have a higher probability of being poorly educated leaving them both unable to communicate effectively with teachers and to support their children when they struggle at school economic compulsions cause many children to drop out at secondary school level in order to supplement family incomes in such cases children do not have the flexibility of distance learning or flexible hours of schooling at a high quality children from socially marginalized groups tribal communities or low castes are often marginalized within the education systems as well by teachers and their peers children from linguistic minorities face significant hurdles to learning when the medium of instruction is in a language different from what children speak and learn at home they face a double barrier that of learning itself and of learning the language of learning figure

for education the implications of evolving demographics the demographic profiles of the developed and developing worlds are widely different figures and figure population structures in developed countries by gender and the majority population in developed countries will be in the years age groups by of this draft not for circulati on population nearly all will have gone through school education and nearly two thirds will have gone through some form of vocational or higher education in its youth this population will be part of a global work force competing with younger more recently skilled workers from other countries as societys needs evolve its citizens will require new knowledge and skills to meet those needs yet the largest share of the population in these countries does not currently have structured access to means of acquiring these skills over their working lifetimes figure population structures in developing countries by gender and in comparison by the majority of the developing world population will be in the years age groups the largest increases are estimated to be in age categories years and the years age groups in todays terms this population comprises children ranging from those yet to be born to those who are currently years of age and those between years of age both these age groups will determine the productivity the social structures and the civic fabric of their societies these demographic shifts are dramatic and have profound implications for the scale and nature of education needs that will emerge they point to the need to not just prepare todays children but create ways of enabling women and men of all age groups to acquire the tools necessary to be productive citizens figure demonstrates the gap in todays educational architecture the current system defined by the bars representing current enrolments reaches only a quarter of the population and in the case of developing countries reaches less than half of the and the years population segments in the case of the school going population the figure camouflages the realities of inequitable access and poor quality that despite the physical access fail to deliver on the promise of education figure the limited reach of the education sector draft not for circulati on the implications of this gap are clear first the focus of education cannot be on the primary school age group alone years in developing countries the years age group and the years age groups are where the coverage gaps are highest over the year period in developed countries while current coverage levels are high the majority of the population will be in its late working age without the means to acquire new competitive skills in both cases systems of learning have to become more open to young children and adults the importance of early childhood learning and development why does the age group matter today million children worldwide do not survive to their fifth birthday and over million children who do survive do not reach their developmental potential in early childhood as indexed by either stunting or exposure to absolute poverty risks such as maternal malnutrition or poor mental health lack of recommended breastfeeding lack of access to clean water and sanitation lack of learning opportunities and exposure to violence lead to this loss of human potential such experiences can get under the skin overwhelming the bodys stress mechanisms and immune functions these million children are at high risk for school failure early pregnancy joblessness and chronic and costly adult diseases the large number of the worlds children starting life at severe risk and experiencing toxic stress threatens the goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development today traditional systems of education are not designed for children below years most are dependent largely on household and informal care they require support for their early cognitive physical social and emotional development which is especially rapid in the years that the foundations of brain architecture and lifelong learning are being built because the kind of care needed at these ages requires coordinated attention from health education and social protection sectors formal education systems cannot act alone to support early childhood development even if we consider only the constrained task of providing pre primary education in centers most formal education systems have been unable to integrate pre primary care systematically into their structures the need for adult non formal and continual education opportunities draft not for circulati on out of school children illiterate men and women or adults who dropped out of school are not targeted by formal education systems in a systematic high quality manner while most countries have structures for non formal and continuing education the quality of curriculum and teaching the effort towards outreach and the flexibility offered to students is highly variable with generally poor outcomes and extremely low coverage and yet adult learning especially for women is critical not just for its own sake but because it has multiplier effects on households and communities as described above parental literacy is a significant predictor of student performance it can also improve parenting especially parents ability to support their learning additionally as the demographic forecasts show the years age group today will be the largest population cohort in given low rates of secondary and tertiary enrolments the majority of these men and women are not highly educated the ability of countries to reach out to them through continual and remedial adult education will be critical to bring them into civic and economic activities and to maximize their potential to contribute to sustainable development in many countries this cohort may be larger than the cohort enrolled in primary and secondary schools this will require a significant effort to scale up adult education and most developing countries are not prepared for such an expansion what are children and adults learning most formal systems of education focus on numeracy reading and writing skills they do not systematically measure or even recognize a broader more ambitious set of learning outcomes skills of analysis and critical reasoning innovative thinking interpretation and socialization are not recognized systematically as required and basic skills that students must acquire to complete their education learning is not just about math and literacy it encompasses social and emotional learning and st century skills teamwork organizational skills autonomous learning self direction creativity innovation etc these are the priorities not only for students but for their teachers their parents and all adults who come in contact with them learning also encompasses the much wider range of contexts and individuals most importantly adults parents teachers community members in workplaces households community settings low levels of basic numeracy and literacy skills estimates suggest that over million children around the world lack the ability to read write and count despite being in school for four years or more the inability of governments to ensure basic literacy and numeracy skills at the primary school level despite an unprecedented expansion in schooling per se is the single greatest challenge facing basic education while most countries have draft not for circulati on managed a significant and often rapid expansion in access to classrooms and teachers this has not translated into improved learning levels at the post primary level the path is even steeper the precedent of wealthy countries shows that average learning outcomes improve slowly at the national level and based on the experience of wealthy countries improving learning outcomes through the traditional route of increased expansion of formal schooling will take decades if not centuries poor learning levels in emerging cross country assessments at the secondary level the evidence on learning outcomes across the developing world is scattered but what we know is dramatic and worrying there are still relatively few instruments of globally comparable assessments that we can to use to learning levels across countries since the first internationally comparable student achievement tests began through the first international mathematics study fims in just over international tests have been conducted globally culminating in the recent trends in international mathematics and science study timss and the programme for international student assessment pisa exams these tests cover math science and reading for age grade groups primary education ages lower secondary education ages and the final year of secondary education grade most of the countries in the pisa and timss samples are high or middle income countries even within this limited set of countries a few patterns are clear first among developed countries there is a poor correlation between education spending and learning outcomes second most middle and low income countries rank consistently low in these tests with the exception of parts of china and other east asian countries third within developing countries over half the children tested fail to clear the lowest level of the tests as compared to less than percent in average oecd countries in the absence of data on a wider set of learning and well being outcomes these results are far from the final word on cross country learning outcomes but they are an important first glimpse into the global competitiveness of developing country education systems over the past few years a number of research and advocacy efforts around the world have turned the attention of educationists and policy makers to the question of learning outcomes and life skills that are critical to enable children to lead productive fulfilling lives the learning metrics task force is a global effort hosted by the brookings institute that is aiming to define learning and measurement standards for children around the world the task force is in the process of defining a much broader concept of learning characterized under seven domains of learning that we return to later see chapter for a more detailed discussion basic numeracy and literacy skills for adult women and men draft not for circulati on just under half of all adult women and thirty percent of adult men in low and middle income countries are illiterate the inability to read and write hampers these women and men in multiple ways it prevents them from engaging with the economy in any way other than basic manual work thus limiting their lifelong earning potential it exposes them to risks of exploitation it prevents them from exercising their basic rights as citizens and community members it restricts their ability to be effective parents and provide their children with a learning environment it hampers their ability to access public financial and other social services and most importantly it creates a crisis of confidence which holds them back from using their talents and skills to their maximum potential national adult literacy programs have had limited success in reaching and teaching women in particular creating an unsustainable gender imbalance while women need basic numeracy and literacy they are not sufficient by themselves transforming adult literacy programs into broader adult and continuing education programs with exposure to financial health and digital literacy is now essential education for sustainable development the world will face new and more complex challenges over the coming decades global warming and its attendant consequences in the form of changing weather patterns shifting agricultural production and new health risks together with burgeoning populations rapid urbanization and rapidly diminishing natural resources will bring in the need for new skills especially in the developing world these skills simply do not exist today developing new technologies for managing alternate sources of energy developing sustainable modes of living developing sustainable models of food production building and managing resilient urban infrastructure protecting and adapting to natural disasters preventing and treating new diseases are some examples higher education systems across the developing world are not prepared to provide these skills and primary and secondary education systems are not prepared to build the foundation skills that support them understanding the needs of society for sustainable development and creating solutions that work will require working closely with policy makers public organizations and private companies and to train people who can implement these solutions at scale as the global economy adapts to climate change new green occupations will emerge more and more jobs are expected to come up in renewable energies environment and new technologies the transition to a green economy will not only change the profile of the new labour demand but will also change the scope and nature of existing jobs significant research is needed to assess the impact of greening economies on skill needs the transformation although slow will affect skill needs in various ways including through structural changes in the economy generated by the gradual shift to a green output which will lead to new enterprises and to the technological change of existing ones certain jobs will draft not for circulati on disappear and new ones will emerge and the education sector will need to adapt rapidly through changes in content qualification standards and training programs all of these changes will require that education systems prepare ahead of the change peak in the real economy anticipating needs and giving time to learning processes to properly empower new comers with knowledge and skills preparing young people for work young women and men coming out of school do not have clear pathways to work remediation is a first challenge for those that have dropped out before completing school percent of the students enrolled in lower secondary drop out by the last grades of secondary school and work in the informal sector identifying ways in which they can be taught skills that allow them to earn a decent livelihood or be self employed will be an immediate challenge for most countries their inability to meet it will not just create an unfulfilled potentially destabilizing large group of young people it will forego the promise of a demographic dividend that would otherwise create the platform for social and economic prosperity formal vocational or school to work programs reach a small fraction of young people between the ages of years existing programs are designed for industrial and some service sector work technical vocational work such as plumbing electricians mechanical skills or basic computer and language skills yet a much wider set of skills will be needed for the kind of jobs that will emerge in the coming decades skills that reflect the ability to work in teams organize information adapt to rapidly changing environments solve problems and be innovative these skills cannot be taught in short after school programs they need to be embedded in education from early childhood onwards and need to be continually renewed with lifelong learning preparing adults for work in a globalized society the costs of tertiary education are rising rapidly making it increasingly unaffordable for middle and lower income students at the same time the content of tertiary education is failing to keep pace with the evolving needs of society and the economy difficult economic conditions point to a related paradox a perceived shortage of job skills across the world combined with high unemployment rates among young people in the developing world gross enrolments are around percent in the developed countries there is a mismatch between the education provided and the skills demanded by employers over percent employers blame skills shortages for entry level vacancies at the same time over half of student graduates do not believe that their post secondary education improved their employment opportunities over the next decade and a half these economic opportunities will evolve more rapidly than before draft not for circulati on the world is more interconnected today than ever before this means that contagion effects will be much stronger in the future as already seen in the global economic slowdown since countries will need to adapt rapidly to changing economic fortunes and growth sectors within national economies will shift the spread of information technology has fundamentally altered the profile of skills needed for different kinds of work knowledge accumulation no longer commands the premium that it did before the advent of the internet interpretation analysis and management of knowledge and its application to the world are much more valued skills increasing automation in manufacturing is another irreversible trend both of these together imply that the content of education at the secondary and tertiary levels will have to change with an emphasis on building abilities to manage environments technology and people at different levels of complexity at the same time developing countries need skills to manage food production and enhance farm productivity to look after local and national natural resources to manage health needs of their population and organize their societies needs for energy water and basic services these skills are in short supply as well and unlike in the formal economic sector they cannot be easily imported traditional knowledge in these areas is kept out of formal education systems but will be invaluable in preparing young people to take on community leadership roles challenges of delivering education to children and adults are education systems geared towards lifelong learning the current centralized model of teaching is ill equipped to enable the kind of learning required by different groups in the case of children in the under age group for example integrated health educational and social interventions require a combination of effort from the family community and public services across sectors at the school level a focus on learning a broad set of skills will fundamentally change the role of the teacher and training for work and higher studies will require close coordination with future employers the paucity of teachers and their changing role successful education systems revolve around the teacher as critical for learning countries that are unable to deploy a cadre of highly skilled motivated teachers struggle to achieve high quality challenges start from the point of selection globally there is an estimated shortfall of million teachers of which million pertains to sub saharan africa alone these numbers do not include the need to replace teachers who retire the gaps at pre primary or secondary level or the need to train and develop the large numbers of untrained and under qualified teachers who are already in post countries face different yet equally critical issues several lack selection systems that can identify draft not for circulati on develop and support high quality teachers in many countries teaching was once a coveted and socially respected profession with widening economic and social opportunities its role in the occupational hierarchy has declined teacher training institutions vary dramatically across countries but share some common features curriculum is infrequently revised especially to keep pace with the rapid changes in the economic and social structures of society the role of teachers is seen as transmitters of knowledge not enablers of learning teachers are not taught to cope with the variation in childrens backgrounds and learning levels and once teachers graduate there is often little follow up once teachers enter the classroom either through mentoring and support or through continuing learning once teachers enter the schooling system they often work in high stress environments very often with large and multi grade classes with very poor supporting infrastructure there is a large gap between the theoretical instructions provided to teachers during their training and the realities of the classroom that they struggle with each day further as enrolments have risen rapidly in many countries there is a large number of para teachers with much lower qualifications and training than regular teachers this has raised the urgent need to expand training opportunities innovate around training models and have ways to continually support the professional development of teachers in the classroom teacher pay varies across countries and there are few incentives financial and non financial that reward efforts to improve learning outcomes for students more importantly teachers systematically lack an enabling and supportive environment at work one that encourages and rewards innovations in the classroom which offers practical support for specific in class challenges which creates a mentoring system where new teachers can learn from their more experienced colleagues and one where the skills and knowledge base of teachers is continually upgraded in most countries teachers are also seen as the last mile providers of state services in conducting surveys for example which take away from their teaching obligations despite these challenges most teachers perform heroically in the classroom contributing to these teacher quality problems is a gap in education leadership starting at the head master or principal level and including higher district to subnational levels in many countries this position is attained solely through seniority the competencies that make for effective school level leadership are usually undefined in systems the lack of specialized training and professional development for education leaders across dimensions of organizational instructional and family and community leadership contributes to the lack of school level supports for teachers to engage in their own learning and improvement it is also critical to develop shared and distributed leadership in schools contributing to teachers self efficacy and collaborative capabilities a broader role for parents and communities draft not for circulati on most systems of education usually ignore the role of parents and communities both in determining the content and purpose of education and in their roles in its effective delivery first generation learners have significantly lower learning outcomes pointing to the potential of parents and families with adequate support to create a nurturing environment for learning and be a powerful lever for sustainable development a new generation of support that reflects models of inter generational and adult learning is missing education systems do not yet adequately recognize that learning takes place not just in schools but also at home and among peer groups and opportunities to structure learning across these settings need to be encouraged a focus on a broad set of learning outcomes will require that parents participate in efforts to support learning they can also participate in efforts to evaluate teacher performance demand greater accountability and participate in school decision making on their part schools will need to engage networks of parents to spread learning that begins in school across villages neighbourhoods and communities more systematically discussions of the purpose of education the pedagogy and the curricula exclude parents and the wider community from where the students come in the case of developing countries the design and content of the education system has been imported from a western model that is often at odds with the realities of societies and the traditional knowledge skills and modes of instruction of the communities that students come from the first example of such a divergence occurs in the medium of instruction when children learn in a language that is not their local dialect or mother tongue it makes learning more difficult the second example is in the context of the subject matter which rarely refers to the realities of the childrens lives the third example is in the kind of skills that children are expected to learn which are often not referenced to the needs of their communities or families these forms of disconnect also mean that education is a finite static phenomenon that children enter into and exit from without continuing it through the rest of their lives without allowing for learning in adulthood and without allowing for the lessons of adulthood to inform the learning experience the role of the state traditionally the content and design of education has been the preserve of the public sector partly because of its role as a basic public good partly because of the state viewing it is as an instrument to build citizenship and common social values and partly because of its potential as an avenue for social and economic mobility requiring it to be accessible by all children regardless of ability to pay indeed there is no example of a country with high educational outcomes where the provision of basic education has been in the private domain the massive expansion of educational access across the developing world in the post colonialism era starting from followed this pattern as well as evidenced by draft not for circulati on patterns of public expenditures on education across the world much of the developed world spends approximately percent of gdp on education slightly lower or stagnant from s levels low income countries by contrast spend approximately percent of gdp on education up from percent of gdp in public education systems are now under threat across several countries in the developing world two separate phenomena have emerged within a context of an increased demand for education during the last decade first the mushrooming of private schools including so called low fee private schools to meet the demand for quality education across large parts of south asia in particular where nearly one third of children in rural areas attend private schools second there is a proliferation of after school tuition classes that are privately arranged in south and east asia to supplement in school learning both these phenomena find reflection in a rising share of the private sector enrolments especially at the secondary level see figure below figure growth of proportion privately enrolled at primary and secondary levels by region source efa global monitoring report database both these phenomena have led to several implications first in countries with significant private enrolments private enrolment rates greater than percent of total an increasing proportion of teaching is now happening outside of the public schooling infrastructure this means that any efforts at improving quality will have to engage both the public and private sectors second parents are spending a significant share of their income on private education this has a substitution effect creating further household impoverishment with corresponding reductions in household spending on either health or nutrition or other basic goods moreover households who are unable to cover the costs for education for all their children may prioritise the education of their boys third it leads to a reinforcing cycle of draft not for circulati on deteriorating quality within the public system which ends up catering to only students from the most deprived households or in the most remote regions that have no other options fourth the development of a parallel commercial market for education is likely over time to milk the best resources out of the public system leading to further deepening of inequalities in the provision of education fifth the quality of private education is highly variable evidence shows that private schools do tend to outperform public schools but not after controlling for the socio economic background of students and the level of autonomy enjoyed by private schools in the case of post secondary education the state is largely responsible for undergraduate education while the private sector is becoming a significant player in vocational technical and professional education a basic challenge that will arise will be to balance the role of the state as the main provider of basic education with demands that exceed its existing capacities this will require systemic improvement in the quality of education provided by the state through a combination of resources and better governance a slow process that will need tremendous political foresight and will it will require rebuilding trust in the quality of public schooling not just amongst the poor but amongst the middle and high income families as well finally it will require imagination to create new and creative ways of reaching students with quality education regardless of their existing mode of instruction a theme that we return to in section in more detail draft not for circulati on goals for the next two decades context since education was declared as a basic human right over six decades ago many efforts have been launched to deliver this right to every child in the world in over governments came together to adopt the world declaration on education for all at jomtein thailand to set global goals for education ten years later countries met at the world education forum in dakar senegal and adopted six education for all goals the millennium development goals set in were a broader set of goals with two that focused specifically on education table table international education goals draft not for circulati on international goals aim to bring together political commitment backed by policies financing and legal frameworks so that the right to education can be actualized by every child global trends of educational enrolments have been improving steadily with a distinct upturn in south and west asia and sub saharan africa since it is not possible to credit this upturn in both primary and secondary enrolments to the adoption of international goals alone improvements reflect rising demand for education greater prioritization of education within countries access to greater resources and yet the goals have helped bring about all of these factors as well figure figure historical trends and projections post development agenda consensus on quality and lifelong learning as the post development agenda takes shape there have been many proposed goals for education all of which recognize the centrality of quality and learning as national objectives the high level panel of eminent persons in its report proposes the following goal and targets on education provide quality education and lifelong learning targets include a increase by x the proportion of children able to access and complete pre primary education b ensure every child regardless of circumstance completes primary education able to read write and count well enough to meet minimum learning standards c ensure every child regardless of circumstance has access to lower secondary education and increase the proportion of adolescents who achieve recognized and measurable learning draft not for circulati on outcomes to x d increase the number of young and adult women and men with the skills including technical and vocational needed for work by x the global thematic coalition on education has proposed a similar goal on equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all sdsn leadership council education goals recommendation the sdsn leadership council has proposed an education goal and three accompanying targets as part of the next set of goals focused on the challenge of sustainable development reflecting the emerging challenges discussed previously the sdsn proposal differs from existing proposals on counts first it recognizes the gap around early childhood development and the comprehensive nature of interventions that would be necessary to ensure that all children receive the support they need at the beginning of life second it emphasizes learning effectiveness as the central measure to define success at all ages and third it focuses not just on academic or employment related skills but learning for the sake of creating citizens who can participate in building a sustainable world goal ensure effective learning for all children and youth for life and livelihood all girls and boys complete affordable and high quality early childhood development programs and primary and secondary education to prepare them for the challenges of modern life and decent livelihoods all youth and adults have access to continuous lifelong learning to acquire functional literacy numeracy and skills to earn a living through decent employment or self employment the sdsn leadership council has also proposed targets to underline the goals described below in addition the sdsn leadership council has identified a core set of indicators linked to each target that constitute the minimum set needed to measure progress towards the goal a detailed description of all the goals targets and indicators can be found in annex along with the core indicators an additional set of tier indicators are proposed which can be modified and implemented at the national level target a all children under the age of reach their developmental potential through access to quality early childhood development programs and policies proposed core indicators proportion of children receiving at least one year of a quality pre primary education program early childhood development index tier indicators proportion of children under experiencing responsive stimulating parenting in safe environments percentage of pupils enrolled in early childhood development programs receiving providing basic drinking water adequate sanitation and adequate hygiene services target b all girls and boys receive quality primary and secondary education that focuses on learning outcomes and on reducing the dropout rate to zero primary completion rates for girls and boys percentage of girls and boys who master a broad range of foundational skills including proficiency in reading and foundational skills in mathematics by the end of the primary school cycle based on credibly established national benchmarks secondary completion rates for girls and boys proportion of girls and boys who achieve proficiency across a broad range of learning outcomes including in mathematics by end of the lower secondary schooling cycle based on credibly established national benchmarks tier indicators developmental potential encompasses physical cognitive social and emotional domains of learning and development proportion of girls and boys who acquire skills and values needed for global citizenship national benchmarks to be developed by the end of lower secondary school target c ensure all youth transition effectively into the labour market youth employment rate disaggregated by formal and informal employment tertiary enrolment rates for young women and men tier indicators proportion of adolescents years with access to school to work programs percentage of young people not in education training or employment percentage of young adults years with access to a learning program proportion of young adults years who are literate achieving these goals will not be easy the previous chapters outlined the challenges that need to be addressed and this chapter proposed the goals that would be required to guide the work of the education sector over the next decade and a half in the subsequent chapters the report outlines the actions that will be required to achieve these goals combining the evidence from programs and policies across the world and matching the evidence to the kinds of research that will be required to allow countries to track indicators to measure progress towards the goal of education for a sustainable world supporting early childhood development for children from to years children are the common basis for all dimensions of sustainable development no advances in sustainable development will occur in coming decades without multiple generations contributing to societal improvement moreover beyond sheer survival children have a right to thrive develop to their full potential and live in a sustainable world childrens health learning and behavior during the early years are the foundation for later school success and completion close nurturing relationships with peers and adults and the capacity to participate in community workplace and society young childrens growth and development in addition is profoundly shaped by the opportunities for learning education resources and interactions provided by adults whether they encounter these adults in home care service or community contexts early childhood is thus a critical stage of development it is a culmination of learning for one generation embodied in the beginning of a lifetime of learning for the next to address the growing challenges of environmental crises poverty and inequality and domestic and armed conflict a transformative approach to learning lifelong inter generational and encompassing health cognition and behavior is required when we consider the learning life course in this way the need for integrated approaches that include but are not limited to the traditional education sector becomes apparent this life course perspective also draws attention to the need for education for sustainable development with an emphasis upon global interdependence and civic responsibility starting early in life in this section we synthesize the science of global early childhood development in order to identify how a focus on early childhood development can contribute to societal transformation and sustainability how early childhood development occurs definitions of early childhood vary in different countries and regions according to local traditions and the organization of primary school systems in some countries the transition to primary school occurs soon after years old in other countries this transition takes place at around years old we define early childhood as the period of human development from prenatal through the transition into the early primary grades years of age the subsequent section of this report covers education from to years of age the overlap is intentional as early primary education can benefit from extension of principles of effective holistic early childhood development the foundations of brain architecture and functioning and subsequent lifelong development are laid down in early childhood in a process that is exquisitely sensitive to external influence early experiences in the home in other care settings and in communities interact with genes to shape the developing nature and quality of the brains architecture the growth and then environmentally based pruning of neuronal systems in the first years support a range of early skills including cognitive early receptive and expressive language early literacy numeracy and math social and emotional theory of mind or perspective taking empathy pro social behaviors self regulation and executive function voluntary control of attention and behavior skills in addition to health and physical development each of these skills measured in early childhood is predictive of school success and completion higher earnings active positive participation in communities and society and reduced odds of delinquency crime and chronic and non communicable disease we define developmental potential to encompass indicators of physical cognitive social and emotional development during early childhood later skills in schooling in employment in family life build cumulatively upon these dimensions of developmental potential therefore as the economist james heckman has argued investment in learning and development during early childhood results in greater cost savings than investment later in the life cycle the capacity of a nation to build sustainable systems and infrastructure innovate and invest in technology and grow while reducing impact on the earths resources all depend on a workforce with the skills that are foundational to civic engagement creativity and productivity the period of early childhood is critical in this regard there is a direct link between developmental potential in early childhood and a nations potential for sustainable development early childhood development ecd programs and policies have been defined as a comprehensive set of policies and programs for children from the prenatal period to eight years of age their parents their caregivers and their communities their purpose is to uphold the childs rights to develop his or her full cognitive emotional social and physical potential investments in ecd programs and policies with essential quality features support these rights and substantially increase the odds of children reaching their developmental potential with commitment and participation from the national to the local and community levels and across government and civil society such programs and policies can substantially add to a nations social and economic potential in low middle and high income countries alike ecd programs and policies such as the ones we review below are some of the most cost effective interventions for a range of long term outcomes important to society including completed schooling higher lifelong earnings and reduced violence and crime many of the recommended maternal and infant health interventions from the prenatal to age period show evidence of cost effectiveness the combination of nutritional breastfeeding and complementary feeding and parenting support from birth to years has produced long term life course increases in educational attainment and earnings and raising preschool enrollment to in every country has been estimated to result in benefits of over billion us with a benefit cost ratio of between and depending on the discount rate such programs and policies can contribute substantially to a broader development agenda to fight poverty and inequality and to ensure that all children reach their developmental potential despite the well established promise of investing in the early years million children worldwide do not survive to their fifth birthday and over million children who do survive experience severe risk as indexed by either stunting or exposure to absolute poverty risks such as exposure to environmental toxins lack of access to clean water and sanitation maternal under nutrition poor maternal mental health lack of recommended breastfeeding lack of learning opportunities and exposure to violence lead to this loss of human potential such experiences have lifelong consequences for health conditions and disease school progress employment and the ability to participate in community and society the evidence base on ecd programs policies and systems given the current status of the global evidence base which interventions in the early years show the most promise of ensuring that all children reach their developmental potential in early childhood how can they be implemented in the context of diverse communities and national systems in ways that fulfill that promise we synthesize the evaluation literature and future directions across six major themes intended to support the achievement of target a and the other ecd related indicators of the sdsn in the next years an integrative approach to health and learning supporting parenting and early childhood education social protection workforce development and non formal education social inclusion for the most vulnerable measuring early childhood development to track progress on target a and effective implementation of programs and policies to support the target when evidence on particular ecd themes relates to indicators for other goals we reference those indicators achieving target a through integrative health nutrition and learning interventions associated indicators for this theme beyond the indicators for target a material in this section relates to indicators under other goals particularly when disaggregated for the early childhood period as the sdsn recommends these other indicators include those associated with goal prevalence of stunting in children under years of age proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption and proportion of population with shortfalls of essential vitamins iron iodine folates goal unmet need for family planning goal birth registration coverage goal percent of population with access to emergency obstetric care proportion of children fully immunized proportion of tb cases proportion of population with advanced hiv infection proportion of malaria infections addressed by timely diagnosis and treatment incidence and death rates associated with malaria under mortality infant mortality maternal mortality rate goal proportion of rural population with access to improved water source proportion of rural population with access to improved sanitation and goal proportion of urban households with access to safe sufficient drinking water proportion of urban households served by safe sanitation services proportion of urban households with access to regular solid waste collection percentage of sewerage and wastewater treated recommendation assure universal access to reproductive health care including comprehensive prenatal screening education and health care visits that include preparation for delivery parenting support and family planning options recommendation provide nutritional supports for pregnant and lactating mothers and appropriate breastfeeding and nutrition education exclusive breastfeeding before months of age and complementary feeding together with nutritional supplementation beyond months of age recommendation provide universal regular immunisations comprehensive child screening and treatment and water sanitation and hygiene interventions with education for all families an integrated approach to help young children not only survive but thrive has emerged recently in global health key interventions in the areas of family planning maternal and newborn health antenatal care and birth attendance immunisation e g measles bcg diphtheria pertussis and tetanus and preventive and curative care are the basis for maternal and child survival an integrated set of interventions delivered beginning with intrapartum care in health centers clinics is the recommended approach successful interventions can follow and supplement these services throughout the early childhood years in other settings such as community or center based care settings interventions to address maternal and child survival that integrate an emphasis on learning both for the parent and for the growing child through mechanisms such as promotion of stimulating and responsive interactions have substantial added benefits an important and proven example is the combination of breastfeeding nutritional supplementation interventions with parenting support programs to increase exclusive breastfeeding for the first months followed by complementary feeding and nutrition supplementation after months increase child micronutrient intake and health and reduce infant mortality nutrition interventions from to years of this type not only reduce stunting but also raise later school performance and even earnings when components targeting cognitive stimulation and responsiveness during feeding are embedded in nutritional supplementation interventions positive effects on parents and on child health and cognitive outcomes are even stronger one intervention of this type in jamaica had remarkable effects years later as participants reached young adulthood reduced anxiety depression and violent behavior and increased educational attainment earnings and iq the care for child development of unicef and the who responds to this strong evidence base by embedding these practices within large scale health and nutrition systems the key in effective parenting interventions is not so much the setting effective models have been implemented in a huge variety of community settings as well as homes health clinics and workplaces but an emphasis on rapport between the facilitator and the parent and feedback with opportunities for modeling and practice with the child preventive and curative health services are critical components of ecd services yet many show low coverage all can benefit from coordination with education intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for pregnant women and the use of insecticide treated nets for example showed coverage rates averaging in nations with endemic malaria in advances in prevention of mother to child transmission of hiv pmtct programs have produced impressive reductions in infant transmission between and a reduction of incidence in the countries with highest incidence in implementation of the whos guidelines for antiretroviral therapy including extending arv for both mothers and infants would reduce incidence further by and be highly cost effective food fortification and vitamin a iron folate and mms supplementation and interventions to prevent and treat diarrheal disease such as hygiene interventions deworming and zinc supplementation are also proven strategies to reduce health problems that can be integrated with childrens care and learning programs preprimary education and family and community based interventions for example since children of preprimary age very often have younger siblings the provision of programming to support the health of children birth to can be integrated into preprimary education an important dimension of preventive services that can be integrated with universal health interventions in infancy and early childhood is screening for developmental delays the identification of children with special health care needs in the first years of life includes attention to learning delays not just physical health and behavioral delays linking intervention to such screening results is vital to actual improvement of developmental potential for these children ensuring that children identified through screening receive effective services and access to ecd programs and policies across health education and social and child protection will do much to advance the currently often deplorable abandonment neglect and institutionalization of children with disabilities in early childhood system and infrastructural improvements contribute not only to sustainability but also to child survival wash water sanitation and hygiene interventions are effective in reducing risks for diarrhoea and attendant morbidity and mortality a recent meta analysis of program evaluations showed that water interventions of two types those that create new clean water sources and those that address water quality at the source or at the point of use reduce diarrhoeal disease hygiene interventions providing education and encouraging hand washing and the provision of sanitation facilities similarly show positive effects on diarrhoeal as well as asthma and other respiratory diseases however median coverage of sanitation and diarrhea treatment was in countries with demographic and health or multiple indicator cluster survey mics data in finally the use of clean cooking fuels rather than traditional biomass burning cookstoves can reduce disease and death due to respiratory problems here again the integration of health and education is of great importance point of use interventions require effective education which is particularly critical for pregnant mothers and parents with infants and young children achieving target a by enriching parenting and early childhood care and education associated indicators for this theme beyond the two primary indicators for target a material in this section relates to the tier indicator for target a proportion of children under experiencing responsive stimulating parenting in safe environments as well as indicators under goal violence against children including physical punishment or abuse sexual abuse emotional abuse and neglect and goal depression treatment coverage learning is a multi generational enterprise in early childhood regardless of the setting the childs home a village communal space a social network of parents a media based interactive environment or an out of home care or pre primary education setting childrens learning is largely built through interactions with caring adults and peers these may be parents or other family members caregivers in out of home care settings other parents in the community or teachers learning and development in early childhood are supported by the sum total of caring adult and peer interactions that a child encounters in the settings of daily life home child care and early childhood education only through attention to all the settings of early childhood can developmental potential and subsequent sustainable development be assured supporting a young childs development is thus a community responsibility that requires and benefits from opportunities to increase adult learning four sets of adult caregiving roles and skills are causally related to growth in childrens physical cognitive social and emotional development adult and parent health and adequate nutrition caregiving and parenting adult and parent well being and mental health and skilled instruction in quality educational settings we reviewed programs targeting parent health and nutrition previously here we review successful approaches targeting the other three factors as well as future directions for innovation on these fronts supporting caregiving and parenting skills parenting programs to support caregiving stimulation and other parenting skills show positive effects given sufficient intensity and quality they may be particularly important when access to other forms of learning opportunities e g early childhood education is very low or non existent recent evidence suggests the benefits of encouraging caregiving roles and skills that are both culturally and developmentally specific although the developmental importance of responsive caregiving has been established across many cultures for example there is variation in the forms that reciprocal responsive interactions in caregiving can take depending on the developmental stage of the child the specific settings of family and community life and values and beliefs of what constitutes successful development for example cultures vary in the extent to which interdependence vs autonomy are encouraged in childrens relations with one another and with adults successful programs balance these foci in ways sensitive to the ecological and cultural context a parenting program in turkey with long term effects intentionally integrated interdependence and autonomy with sensitivity to child needs in its parenting approach this was done in accordance with the particular sociocultural and historical context of the low income families and communities the program served as childrens behavioral and cognitive capacities become more complex over the first years of life their integration into family and community life changes in nature successful programs are contextually sensitive to these changes programs to improve parents or caregivers interactions with preschool aged children for example have emphasized to different degrees the reduction of acting out or aggressive behaviors the encouragement of autonomy and initiative or the inclusion of those who are excluded from social interactions recommendation implement parenting programs that incorporate opportunities for practice with feedback curricula peer support and ongoing training and supervision for facilitators parenting programs are more effective when they incorporate curricula ongoing training for facilitators practice and feedback and opportunities for peer support and community building approaches to training and professional development for those who provide caregiving and parenting support to parents health educators home visitors community parents are showing evidence of success for example an intensive two year professional development and education program for community mothers engaged in home based care in colombia produced increases in observed quality of caregiving as well as child health and behavior a program in pakistan tailored the care for child development module to provide intensive professional development and supervision to community health workers encouraging responsiveness and stimulation in mothers interactions with their children in the health workers interactions with the mothers and even the interactions of the trainers with the health workers many of whom had relatively low levels of education positive effects were observed on caregiving as well as childrens cognitive language and motor skills at ages and months intensity may also matter in parenting programs with one meta analysis in the u s showing few benefits for children when the number of visits or contacts was or fewer finally effective programs often incorporate a peer support or community building emphasis the building of community level social capital can be an important outcome of parent focused ecd programs recommendation assess and reduce rates of maternal depression with treatment and preventive interventions supporting parent mental health parent mental health problems especially perinatal and postnatal maternal depression have severe consequences for very young childrens nutrition cognitive and social and emotional development depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in high middle and low income countries few large scale programs have been established to treat maternal depression in low and middle income countries one recent intervention providing training to community health workers to implement short cognitive behavioral therapy based intervention to mothers with postpartum depression in pakistan produced large reductions in rates of depression a year later some early childhood interventions have produced long term decreases in depression among participants followed up into adolescence and adulthood in addition social protection programs and policies which can reduce economic worries and stress and bolster parents abilities to provide for their young children may reduce levels of mothers depressive symptoms in the short run thus prevention of parental depression may be possible through human capital and economic interventions recommendation ensure that all children start school on time and acquire basic competencies by age across cognitive social and emotional domains recommendation assure safe and responsive caregiving arrangements for children under recommendation ensure quality in early childhood care and education whether in centers preschools or day care settings through comprehensive standards and effective pre and in service on site professional development support for all caregivers and teachers figure preschool attendance by income quintile by region increasing access to quality early childhood care and education settings with skilled instruction access to preprimary education must be improved as indicated previously in the global report card section of this report the gross enrollment rate in low income countries barely budged from to between and there are large disparities in access by household socioeconomic status in nearly all regions of the world children from the top income quintile are more than twice as likely as the bottom income quintile to experience preprimary education in sub saharan africa the difference is a tenfold one in access see figure as important as access is the quality of learning in early care and educational environments is determined centrally by the quality of interactions and instruction exposure to at least a year of high quality preprimary education for example has consistent and positive short term and long term effects on childrens development in the short run early cognitive skills including reading and math skills are positively affected by preprimary education in low and middle income countries on time primary school entry is increased through quality preprimary education high quality preschool can produce lifelong benefits for society with positive effects observed on years of completed schooling secondary school completion reduced crime reduced early pregnancy and increased earnings these results encompass both small scale demonstrations and large scale programs and are responsible for the impressive benefit cost ratios for preschool or larger across high middle and low income countries preprimary education benefits all children no matter their economic background yet as with many other ecd services those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds benefit the most earlier than the preprimary year exposure to child care settings outside the home can also lead to benefits for young children as long as these settings emphasize quality these positive impacts of quality child care are stronger for more disadvantaged children however this literature on the child impacts of quality of care that supports parental employment comes from high income countries with almost no studies in low and middle income countries standards in preprimary education and child care should encompass two kinds of quality features that are important for childrens learning and development structural quality features associated with greater gains in childrens learning include safety and support for physical health such as access to a clean water source smaller group sizes and lower child adult ratios trained and qualified teachers the institution of not only learning standards but specific developmentally focused curricula to support them and adequate variety of print material toys and other play opportunities these structural resources help set the conditions for but do not ensure the core of preprimary education quality which is process quality the instructional and interactive skills of the teacher or caregiver the ability of teachers and caregivers in particular to provide warm and responsive interactions with children and help children express themselves through culturally appropriate social interactions and elaborated language is central to educational quality in the preprimary setting standards for quality should incorporate attention to cultural and linguistic contexts for example developmental expectations for young children within the religious and cultural context of muslim east africa informed the islamic preschool curriculum of the madrasa early childhood development program that program showed positive effects on the african child intelligence scale and the british ability scale in a controlled evaluation across kenya uganda and tanzania support of both home language and second language in preprimary education can build both sets of language skills and attendant developmental benefits this is important given the disparities in many countries in outcomes between language minority and language majority populations and the exclusion of language minority populations from culturally appropriate educational supports how can both structural and process quality be improved improving the quality of early childhood care and education on both the structural and process dimensions shows important benefits for children including efforts at scale to do so investments are required in physical infrastructure teacher training and learning materials to ensure structural quality strategies to improve process quality and instruction include the integration of on site or technology facilitated observation and mentoring coaching in addition to pre service training with opportunities for practice despite this evidence the vast majority of preprimary education is only supported by pre service training without practice opportunities and often of very low intensity the end result can be low attendance and therefore low levels of exposure to the potential benefits of early childhood education successful early learning programs are not limited to center based preschool media based interventions such as those of the sesame workshop or radio based instruction and communication have shown positive effects on cognitive and also social and emotional development in a variety of low income countries for example new developments in media technologies will provide huge opportunities to improve the early learning of children at scale both in direct programs for children and in technology supported professional development especially in rural and remote areas e g through increasingly sophisticated audio and video capture methods using cell phone technology a key challenge in preprimary education is how to sustain the boost that high quality preschool can provide to childrens learning and early school success the massive increase in access to primary education of the last years has unfortunately not often been accompanied by increases in educational quality or instruction improvement in instructional quality of the early primary grades must follow quality preprimary education or the gains from ecd may be lost support in the early primary grades must facilitate basic competencies and learning across the cognitive social emotional and physical domains as do the higher quality early childhood care and education programs achieving target a through social protection workforce development and non formal education associated indicators for this theme beyond the two primary indicators for target a material in this section relates to indicators under goal proportion of population below per day of per capita income and goal proportion of households with incomes below of country median income beyond adult and caregiving capacities parent economic and educational factors have profound effects on childrens learning and development social protection policies address the pervasive problems of low and fluctuating household incomes and their vulnerability to external forces such as natural disasters climate change famine and severe illness they aim to increase economic stability among the poor through cash transfers whether conditioned on household behaviors or not but also through efforts to promote human capital development as a long term solution early childhood represents the developmental period in life when effects of poverty are most damaging and long lasting in addition it is the period during which children have the greatest dependence on household economic resources and the investments of time shelter food and learning opportunities that resources can buy thus poverty eradication through social protection policies is especially urgent during early childhood recommendation integrate workforce development and non formal education interventions for parents in ecd programs and policies efforts to promote household economic stability and security include workforce development non formal education cash transfer programs and paid leave policies workforce development and non formal education are overlooked approaches to enhancing childrens outcomes for parents of young children despite strong evidence concerning the causal role that parental education levels can play in improving the cognitive and schooling outcomes of children even relatively short periods of participation in non formal education were associated with improvements in childrens school achievement in one causal analysis in addition improving the job skills of parents can lead to the kinds of jobs those with adequate initial pay and opportunities for wage growth and advancement that research shows increases childrens own cognitive skills and later school success although microfinance is an increasingly widespread approach to encouraging financial independence job skills and entrepreneurship among the poor the question of whether such programs have effects on childrens learning or other outcomes is still unresolved with very few studies examining such outcomes cash transfer programs are perhaps the most evaluated social protection policies conditional cash transfer programs with conditions or benefits related to nutrition and child health have reduced stunting and underweight and improved nutritional status in young children such policies focused on nutrition and health as well as those that condition on pre primary enrollment have resulted in improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes for children with effects generally small but larger for mothers with very low levels of education thus social protection policies can play a critical role in supporting learning health and behavior in the early years paid parental leave is a specific kind of cash transfer that serves as an important form of social protection in some countries to support families with infants and young children it replaces lost wages for parents of infants and provides flexibility for the increased costs associated with care for the very young other subsidy systems such as those in health care or nutrition of course can also free up financial resources during this particular period of child development when strains on families budgets and time are high achieving target a through social inclusion and support for the most vulnerable associated indicators for this theme beyond the two primary indicators for target a material in this section relates to indicator or disaggregation for individuals with disabilities goal the indicators of violent deaths per population refugees and internal displacement caused by conflict and violence and the indicator under goal on violence against children including physical punishment or abuse sexual abuse emotional abuse and neglect disparities in access to quality ecd services are pervasive across rural urban origin language majority minority status and household income levels across all regions of the world with higher rates of provision in urban areas and higher participation among more economically advantaged families girls show lower enrollment rates in many countries with variation in region the lowest gender disparities among low and middle income nations are in latin america children with disabilities are excluded from many ecd programs and services due to endemic discrimination as well as lack of preparation and training on the part of systems of provision and lack of enrollment across the world immigrants without full citizenship and residency rights experience lower access to education health and protection often by law their children suffer as a result of their own and their parents lack of rights with lower cognitive and learning outcomes as early as in the first years of life these inequities must be addressed through policies that ensure equitable access to quality ecd services recommendation eradicate exposure to neglect and violence in young childrens homes and communities implement child protection programs that promote responsive nurturing and positive early interactions between caregivers and young children living in impoverished harsh and or violent environments children exposed to neglect and violence whether at the community or family level are at the very highest risk for immediate and long term physical and mental health problems persistent exposure to physical punishment psychological aggression in the home neglect community violence and other sources of toxic stress can create chronic states of anxiety and fear overwhelm the developing bodys natural defences and derail healthy development and the capacity to learn powerful longitudinal evidence shows the lifelong effects of such experiences in early childhood solutions must address the family and systems roots of neglect and violence for example by changing social norms and public laws surrounding these issues engaging men in parenting programs particularly at the transition to fatherhood and through more general efforts to strengthen families such as the approaches we reviewed above in particular embedding family strengthening and violence prevention in systems with wide coverage such as primary health care parenting programs or early childhood care and education as well as in child protection systems holds great promise in reducing the incidence of children witnessing and experiencing violence for example efforts to integrate a socio emotional emphasis in preschool education through focused teacher training reduced levels of aggression and antisocial behavior in preschool aged children in urban jamaica at high risk of violence exposure figure exposure to violent and non violent discipline country sample data for children in emergency and post conflict situations who represent over half of children who are not in primary schooling and likely comparable proportions of children not in preprimary education responsive implementation of early childhood family and learning supports is critical given the rapidity of growth during this developmental period any months lost from the evidence based ecd supports reviewed here represent large costs to society and loss of developmental potential the implementation of portable sets of learning materials e g unicefs early childhood development kit community participation and integration to organize space and conduct outreach and capacity building and training are possible in these settings for children in institutions the provision of caring foster care homes and learning supports is also critical landmark studies from romania and other countries show that the longer the delay of foster care placement out of custodial institutional care in the first years the greater the possibility of irrevocable damage to physical cognitive social and emotional development how to achieve target a through effective implementation in communities and service systems national policy planning in ecd has grown with over nations having passed national legislation and action plans typically spanning the health education social protection and child protection sectors of services when successful these national efforts build on wide consultation across government civil society and local national and international ngos they effectively coordinate the elements of ecd across sectors and across national to subnational and local levels recommendation effective national policy making and action planning in ecd is supported through inter sectoral coordination and wide government civil society and community input recommendation support national ecd action planning through subnational and local participation in governance finance and implementation of ecd programs and policies both policy planning and implementation in ecd benefit from coordination of the health education social protection and child protection sectors yet such integration is difficult to achieve from the standpoints of governance finance and implementation coordinating bodies such as multi sectoral or cross ministry ecd councils can aid tremendously in coordination but only if they have the authority and trust of the various actors coordination must occur both horizontally across sectors and vertically across national to subnational and local levels a recent study in low income countries showed that horizontal coordination for example may be particularly challenging at subnational levels e g state province region or district depending on the countrys socio political structure effective implementation of national policies and action plans in ecd in addition rests on the twin pillars of community participation and service system development and capacity without the development of local capacity and service systems ecd programs and policies themselves are not likely to be sustainable let alone contribute to a sustainable society in expanding ecd programs are often scaled up across cultures communities and nations with reduced levels of resources per child and neglect of local culture language or sources of expertise such scaling without local capacity building can reduce not increase the quality of services as found in some national studies a pure replication approach can result in neglect of local leadership development and buy in with consequences for implementation what are solutions to these dilemmas of at scale change in ecd community participation in ecd can encompass innovation in service development in implementation and in local governance and financing the integration of ecd with local norms regarding vision for child development and adult participation local preferences for modality and content of services and local capacity for governance is often stated in national ecd policies but not very often realized innovations on this front include local budget control and decision making in social sector spending that explicitly includes ecd integration of broad consultation in development of national curricula and standards and bottom up not just top down approaches to assuring quality of implementation at local levels partnerships between civil society organizations research institutions and government at levels from the local to the national can set the stage for these forms of capacity building successful regional approaches to leadership capacity building include the early childhood development virtual university in sub saharan africa in increasing large scale ecd system capacity whether in health education social protection or child protection the implementation of training supports that integrate on site with pre service training has produced positive impacts on children relative to pre service only models continuous quality improvement approaches in which learning communities including families providers and local and regional ngo and government staff define and then measure quality indicators have been used successfully to improve health care systems but until recently rarely in ecd this approach applied to the chilean public preschool system has been successful in engaging multiple stakeholders parents teachers school directors regional ministry staff in coordinated quality measure development tracking and systems improvement these efforts to build ecd systems at scale benefit from effective mass communication of the benefits of early childhood development for families and society communications research in recent years resulted in the dissemination worldwide for example of core ideas such as the rapid development of brain architecture in early childhood the economic benefits of public investment in early childhood and the harmful lifelong effects of toxic stress in the first years effective messages may differ by country cultural and linguistic context and must be accompanied by outreach through media community and peer channels recommendation increase not only public but also private investment in early childhood work toward parity in the proportion of international education aid spent on preprimary and early childhood education programs relative to other levels of education the available data on public or private spending in ecd is most extensive for preprimary education and even there data are missing for many countries comparisons are difficult due to different financing patterns and cost structures for preprimary education across nations the vast majority of countries with available data in spent less than percent of their public education budgets on preprimary education such a target applied to our proposed indicator for public spending could begin to achieve parity with spending on primary education among regions with multiple nations contributing data only central and eastern europe latin america the caribbean and western europe were regions that included more than a couple nations spending over percent in international education aid early childhood education is severely under represented as well public financing of ecd can incorporate local participation ecd is an explicit category for discretionary local budget planning and allocation in some low income countries at the municipality or village level ecd finance can therefore play a role in national efforts in participatory governance effective local budget planning can be supported through capacity building and professional development none of these approaches however should entail charging fees to recipients such an action would risk excluding the most vulnerable children from ecd programs measuring early childhood development to track progress on target a material in this section provides guidance for the target a indicator on the early childhood development index currently measures of young childrens developmental potential encompassing physical cognitive social and emotional dimensions exist and are being implemented across regions for example in the unicef mics or multiple indicator cluster surveys thus target a ensuring that all children reach their developmental potential can be monitored with existing data collection efforts these large scale cross national efforts however cannot replace the need for locally developed and culturally relevant measures of childrens development that are country specific such measures are more likely to include culturally specific outcomes and milestones regardless of the type of assessment measures should be developed with input from a variety of stakeholders across caregivers parents and practitioners as well as across ethnic and linguistic groups recommendation two kinds of measures of child development assessment tools appropriate for monitoring population level child development and tracking developmental growth over time and screening tools to identify individual need for services should be developed for country regional and global use with input from multiple stakeholder groups and attention to cultural relevance recommendation data systems in ecd should be strengthened encompassing complete birth registration and measures of service quality that predict childrens learning and development measures of childrens development two kinds of childrens assessments distinguished by their purposes can inform and be integrated with ecd programs and policies the first can achieve the goal of population wide assessment of childrens progress across different areas of development capturing a snapshot whether national or subnational regional of childrens development these measures should encompass attention to the physical cognitive and socio emotional domains of childrens development in keeping with a comprehensive definition of developmental potential unicefs mics multiple indicator cluster surveys includes an early childhood development module that asks caregivers and parents about their childrens physical cognitive language pre literacy numeracy and socio emotional development approaches to learning such as engagement and curiosity and thus reaches over countries capturing multiple domains of young childrens development other measures of caregiver or parent reported young child development exist or are under development including the early development instrument and the index of early human capability which incorporate items representing each of these domains and are being used across high middle and low income countries important supplements to this form of measure are those assessments that can capture developmental growth in specific areas over time e g growth in language or emotional skills the second form of child assessment is the screening tool which can serve to identify difficulties delays and disabilities in development although data from screening tools can also be summarized across entire populations these have the added function of enabling individual level identification of need for further diagnostic tests and intervention among recent instruments of this type is the guide for monitoring child development gmcd the next challenge in measuring the development of young children for both of these purposes is to supplement adult reported measures with locally developed direct child assessments covering a range of domains of development which are short and feasible to implement several regional and global efforts are proceeding currently to conceptualize develop and implement such child assessments advances should be incorporated in coming years to monitor progress on global ecd indicators measures of social and emotional development self regulation and executive function skills in particular are lacking reflecting the lack of emphasis in the field on non cognitive skills with important life course consequences measures of ecd program quality and policy implementation measures of service quality ranging from those for center based early education programs to the wider variety of services settings in home based and community based programs are urgently needed without better monitoring of such contexts with measures of quality that show adequate prediction to childrens learning health and behavior investments in ecd will fail to deliver promised results center based measures of quality have been developed in specific nations as well as regionally with some applied in multiple countries however most ecd systems still do not use measures of service quality that have been shown to predict childrens learning and development beyond the level of services the regular collection and sharing of systematic information on governance and policy approaches in ecd is beginning for example the world banks saber project provides comparative data on the policy elements of ecd across countries finally there is a great need to improve data system capacity in ecd for example birth registration systems are the foundation on which population based estimates of childrens health progress and supports for ecd can be ascertained yet more than countries do not have fully functioning civil registration systems sub saharan africa and southeast asia are at particular risk with of unaccounted births and deaths in the world from these regions conclusion despite the extraordinary promise of ecd to address both human and societal development millions of children have no access to ecd services for example of children in low income countries had no access to preprimary education in regionally lacked access in sub saharan africa and in the arab states levels of public spending on pre primary education expressed as a percentage of public spending on education were less than in over of countries with available data in the s the costs of business as usual given the proven value of quality ecd programs and policies are very high attention to a child centered perspective in all sustainable development policies will benefit growth and development not just for individual children and families but for entire societies and the world education for children between and years of age achieving target b by ensuring universal access to free quality basic education the accelerated effort at primary school expansion of the last two decades means that the remaining out of school children are truly at the margins of society in remote geographic locations in areas wracked by or just recovering from conflict belonging to the poorest or most discriminated against families or are children who have special needs the marginal cost of including these children is high and reaching them will require both a special outreach effort and a creative flexible approach of the million children out of school over million are concentrated in countries nigeria is the only country where over million children are estimated to be out of primary school pakistan million ethiopia million india million philippines million and burkina faso cote divoire kenya and niger estimated million follow next unesco institute of statistics many other countries have several hundreds of thousands of children out of school but overall numbers are smaller due to differences in population size in all of these countries the out of school children represent a mix not all of them are completely disengaged from the education system many of these children will have enrolled and even probably attended for some time but the system is unable to keep them inside classrooms for all of their primary school years there is a rich policy and academic literature on interventions to increase enrolment and retention in this report we highlight three efforts that have been shown to be catalytic in bringing about change some of these interventions have been implemented at scale others are still relatively new together they represent a big push to allow every child to access learning and education in some cases they draw children into the system in other cases they are designed to follow children and bring education to them wherever they may be we urge all countries to consider these efforts to universalize education recommendation strong support for universal free basic education for all children as a prerequisite for universal enrolment including financial support as needed globally elimination of user fees has been overwhelmingly important in pushing forward enrolment rates especially amongst the poor the cases of guatemala kenya malawi tanzania and uganda among other countries have shown that removing user fees can increase enrolments by up to percent kattan and burnett apart from formal school fees parents incur several other types of financial costs fees for textbooks uniforms extra classes sports facilities etc within the school context and private tuitions after school these costs add up fairly quickly today such charges account for over percent of total education spending very often leading to impoverishment or routine indebtedness of families in many cases children typically girls tend to drop out after a few years removing user fees creates a separate set of challenges for any education system governments need to quickly identify alternate sources of financing and cope with increased demand both of which put pressure on the supply side countries with a large proportion of private enrolments face more difficult challenges parents see fees as a price signal of quality even if they struggle to pay in such cases the focus will need to be on simultaneously building the quality of public education while financially supporting the poorest families in exercising their choice for a high quality education not all out of school children are outside of the schooling system itself many enrol but drop out some are unable to attend regularly and lose their place others are unable to cope academically or need to work to supplement family incomes yet others are either not accessed by the state system or are in settings with very poor quality instruction there is a need for the state to systematically monitor and study reasons for drop outs in such cases the state can provide financing so that private organizations can provide education with governmental aid and regulation for such children who are at the periphery of the education system conditional cash transfers can help in facilitating access to the system conditional cash transfers ccts have had a fairly successful record of inducing rises in primary education enrolment especially in latin america das et al such programs do not work as well in places where the main challenge is supply side delivery of education ccts would most likely work in urban or peri urban areas where schools and teachers are already present and where children are unable to attend for financial or other family reasons if targeted carefully at the poorest children in specific underserved communities ccts could be an effective intervention to encourage participation for a large sub set of the out of school child population recommendation provision of adequate long term and predictable budgetary allocations for universal basic education including through increased tax base and external assistance in those countries where education systems are under resourced the recommendation calling for universal free basic education depends on adequate funding for education two benchmarks are widely used countries spend percent of gnp and percent of national budgets on public education in reality there is wide variation in actual spending levels developing countries spent percent of gnp on education as compared with percent spent by developed countries in for the same year developing countries spent percent of total expenditure on public education the corresponding share for developed countries was lower at both these benchmarks are based on a world bank study that correlated a range of educational inputs including spending to educational outcomes across low income countries bruns et al percent for countries that are severely underfunded an increase in resources dedicated to quality education provision is essential to achieve target b budgetary benchmarks also allow citizens and parents to hold their governments accountable to uphold their commitments to the right to education beyond these benchmarks macroeconomic policies that enable long term predictable funding of the largest costs typically teachers salaries are essential to sustain educational expansion in cases where tax revenues are inadequate development assistance needs to increase to close the gap unesco estimated the total external assistance needed to fund mdg for primary completion at billion the global partnership for education a multilateral fund aimed at directing development assistance to support over national educational plans has an estimated unmet external funding gap of us billion by international and domestic finances need to be allocated quickly to those countries that are severely underfunded as official assistance has declined a number of new innovative financing mechanisms are also available see box box innovative financing in education education remains underfunded in most of the developing world as population grows faster in emerging markets and fragile states quality of education is severely affected by the scarcity of resources and the insufficient public investment in the system with international assistance continuing to decline and education needs growing countries are turning to innovative financing and raising funds from the market the concept of innovative financing was first introduced by the un monterrey consensus of and since then both sovereign donors and private actors have championed a broad range of initiatives meant to mobilize more resources for development to date debt for education swaps have been used in countries predominantly in latin american debtor nations where creditors agreed to forego part of the interest rate and the principal conditional upon investing in education of an agreed amount by the debtor government the world bank international development assistance ida has also utilized credit buy downs and converted credits into grants retroactively should certain development goals in education and other essential services have been achieved debt conversions have had a random approach based on the agreement of creditors and debtors to pursue them but also depending on the availability of hard currency the latter excluding most of the highly indebted poor countries hipc and least developed countries ldc giving more consideration to this potential funding instrument for education in the future may yield more significant results the leading group report of has advanced a series of other proposals for generating funds for development such as taxes on international financial transactions and on sports revenues as well as micro donations on individual bank transactions in which credit card users allow banks to round up their transactions and transfer resulting amounts to education both benchmarks are imperfect since they do not control for variations in sizes of economies and populations typically poorer countries may spend a larger share of gdp which translate into lower absolute per student spending comparable per student costs are harder to estimate though estimates of per student per year were estimated in by various authors bruns et al un millennium project pursuing alternative paths including through special development bonds or expanding international solidarity levy mechanisms on online air tickets hotel bookings and mobile phone calls could provide additional funds for education to overcome declining aid and insufficient domestic resources source undp innovative financing for development a new model for development finance new york recommendation country specific outreach strategies to target the particularly hard to reach children in a mission mode and create solutions to address the specific barriers to participation in the schooling system in addition to the above measures some communities and families will need to be approached in a targeted manner options include identifying local education champions or role models within the community who can form a bridge to the system to see how family constraints can be accommodated ensuring implementation of guidelines for basic physical infrastructure of the school where it is lacking and becomes a barrier girls bathrooms safe and secure routes to and from school residential facilities for nomadic populations etc ensuring that incentives for teachers principals and school administrators are designed in ways that encourage them to overcome social prejudices and create a welcoming environment for these children and encouraging linguistic diversity that allows for children to learn in the language closest to their native tongue if that is not possible time should be specifically budgeted for learning a second language and the curricular expectations from the child revised accordingly to ensure that she or he is not seen as a failure there are several other country specific interventions that can work some have been tried in pilot projects others have been scaled up with varying degrees of success we encourage each country to commit to a detailed specific and targeted strategy to reach its out of school children and to creatively adapt its own systems for different target groups that need to be reached achieving target b by ensuring universal access to quality secondary education over million children of secondary school age are not attending school the big gains of enrolment at the basic education level have not translated into corresponding changes at the secondary level evidence suggests that the returns to schooling increase at the secondary level as compared to primary levels at the secondary level the return for every additional year of schooling can be percent and at the tertiary level as high as percent this means that the difference in incomes between a primary and secondary school graduate is percent and that between a primary and college graduate can be up to percent in the case of girls the positive externalities are even higher additional years of schooling are strongly correlated with smaller family sizes and with percent reductions in infant mortality rates countries are beginning to expand access to secondary education and it is critical that this expansion is done in a way that is consistent with high quality outcomes on learning and preparing young women and men to be productive citizens of their societies recommendation countries focus on universal completion of learning at the secondary school level recommendation if children cannot come to school take schools to children invest in high quality open schooling to accelerate reach the lesson of primary expansion of the past decades has been that it is not enough to expand access to education quality improvement has to take place simultaneously for access to be truly meaningful it is critical therefore to aim for universalizing secondary schooling by ensuring that children learn to standards of secondary schooling whether they are physically inside school premises or not despite the trillion being spent globally on education today the million secondary school age children not in school and their families represent the failure of years of traditional state led education delivery even though this number is in long term decline it is still an affront to the years of effort put in by governments civil society and local communities around the world today with over decades of experience it is critical to think differently about schooling itself for those children who are the hardest to reach it is time to take schooling and education to them directly the experience of open schooling has shown that it can provide the framework for flexibility and inclusion yet it has been neglected systematically by governments as an effective route of education provision open schooling by definition offers pedagogical flexibility individual pacing selection of subjects asynchronous learning institutional flexibility timing of enrolment geographic and age flexibility provisions for special needs students and program flexibility continuous enrolment flexibility in examinations etc all of these features make it amenable to accommodating students who have needs that the formal system is unable to meet open schooling has so far been seen as a poor substitute for the in classroom experience we have relatively little evidence on its performance yet what we do know through existing studies indicates similar academic performances of students of open schools when compared to those from traditional schools on average many countries lack a formal policy on open schooling and a regulatory structure that defines the outcomes of such a model such a high quality flexible medium of instruction through open schooling should be developed and first applied to children who are not part of traditional systems achieving target b by focusing on broad learning outcomes equity of access is necessary for universal education but the success of an education system will eventually be measured not by how many children are in classrooms but by the quality of education they receive while in or out of those classrooms the underlying assumption of universalizing access over the past several decades measured either through enrolment or completion rates was that once children were in the classroom they were learning age appropriate subject matter we now know that assumption to be patently untrue a series of studies over the past several years have shown that there is at best a tenuous link between classroom presence and learning this is a sobering finding it calls into question over decades of education policy worldwide that focused on expansion of access and provision of inputs it has already provoked a shift in global emphasis to learning outcomes and how best to ensure that global and national education policy is refocused accordingly along with focusing on children who are struggling such a focus can also allow specific education interventions for gifted children who need special pedagogical tools and curricula to realize their full potential traditionally national governments in low and middle income countries have measured the success of their education policies through a combination of access and completion indicators and through standardized exams at the end of each schooling system typically grades depending on the country as an accepted proxy for learning in several countries standalone efforts at measuring learning have shown that children fall behind so much earlier that by the time the proxies are used the majority of the children have already dropped out in india pakistan and in some of the african countries civil society run surveys aser aser pakistan uwezo have found a majority of students lag several years behind in their reading and math ability a trend that is stubbornly static and in some cases showing a decline over the past eight years in which these assessments have been done recommendation ensuring all children attain basic learning goals in primary segment every year nearly percent of children currently in primary school fail to complete the full primary cycle in terms of attainment the percentage is much higher many of them acquire some rudimentary skills but are far below their age and grade appropriate learning levels in fact the current system of age appropriate enrolment in grades has de facto been replaced by multi level and multi grade classrooms it has been shown that grouping children by learning levels and teaching according to levels to bring all on par works when large numbers of children in primary grades lag behind several years in their basic learning a focus on system wide remediation can boost overall learning levels and may give children an incentive to continue in school and give them additional attention time and resources to can allow for the opportunity to close their learning gaps preliminary evidence suggests an improvement in learning but the information is not systematic to be able to conclusively document the benefits of system wide remediation for higher grades and more complex topics there is less information recommendation countries set national learning goals in line with international norms at the beginning middle and end of their schooling cycle the success of education policies is best measured against the outcome of learning if children are learning well they will be motivated to continue to study and overall drop out rates will fall if they complete their full schooling cycle they will be in a position to study further and acquire specific skills contributing more effectively to the economy countries have so far shied away from focusing on learning clearly it is much harder to focus on learning than focusing on inputs which though important are ultimately factors that determine how a student performs and should be treated as such the development of national assessments that are in accordance with contextually relevant national standards is likely to have significant impact on quality there is also a case to make for exploring how best to peg national goals to international norms increasing global connectivity will continue to make more occupations mobile and eventually students will need to be globally competent we are beginning to see examples of this through a widening of the pisa tests for example the challenge of international or uniform goals setting is that of heterogeneity and context countries have different national educational objectives curricula and evaluation methods and imposing a uniform testing approach may not be possible or useful this is why this report does not recommend imposing one single standard rather it recommends developing global benchmarks that countries can use as norms based on which they can set national goals recommendation a comprehensive framework of learning underlines the learning goals one that fulfils basic numeracy and comprehension skills but also prepares students for life and livelihoods what students learn will change fundamentally in the coming years there are several global efforts to define the core set of skills that students need to master during their school years the global learning metrics task force lmtf is a major global effort that has outlined a core set of skills for learning that encompasses the following seven domains as important for all children and youth from early childhood through post primary physical well being social and emotional culture and the arts literacy and communication learning approaches and cognition numeracy and mathematics and science and technology these are critical life skills and will need to be detailed in context to national needs in addition content needs to reflect learning for wellbeing to maximize physical emotional and cognitive potential of children while also preparing them for country specific needs in some cases foreign languages in other cases financial and digital literacy previously the learning first research study identified an ambitious research agenda to inform policy issues around building a framework of learning todays young people are also going to be the generation that faces and manages the challenges of sustainable development classrooms need to teach children systematically how to live and work in and make their societies sustainable for themselves and future generations finally navigating the transition from adolescence to adulthood is a set of skills that few education systems teach their children education systems have to provide a more structured pathway to work either by preparing young people for further training by fostering entrepreneurship skills that will allow them to earn their own livelihoods or by preparing them immediately for work in their communities and local economies see section recommendation countries institute regular national sample assessments conducted independently drawing from the curriculum but in line with global norms countries need to systematically measure how learning outcomes change over time based on different pedagogical and structural interventions very few countries do so regularly today but without this knowledge it will be impossible to either set meaningful goals or to make serious efforts at achieving them standardized national level examinations fail in this task in most countries they draw solely from the curriculum and especially in large countries are limited by the quality of evaluators and exam setters they rely on the ease of examining knowledge retention and often replication of the prescribed text shifting the focus to a broad range of learning outcomes will be a big leap for most developing countries such a leap can begin by creating independent assessment bodies that are structurally autonomous from both the ministries of education and the curriculum framing bodies such a body could draw on experts from within and outside the country to design ways of evaluating a broad set of learning domains as being defined above by the lmtf learning goals should inform a framework of assessment throughout the school cycle so that childrens performance can be monitored periodically and where learning is not happening steps can be taken immediately the formative assessments by teachers in the classroom are critical to strengthen so that they can active contribute to improving learning and empowering teachers to do better at the same time results of learning assessments are often unintelligible to lay people especially parents while it is important to have sophisticated detailed normative assessments it is equally if not more important that parents of children learn about learning levels in a transparent manner at the same time it is important to note that an overemphasis on assessments can be counter productive they can create perverse incentives for teachers to teach to the tests and end up narrowing the scope of what children are taught they may penalize poorly performing children or worse create standards that are not contextual or comparable further it is important to note that not everything of importance in education can be easily measured and it is important to value a broad range of outcomes even those which are less easy to measure recommendation priorities of teachers school principals administrators and the local community including pedagogy budgets performance incentives and system guidelines are oriented around learning goals for their children a focus on learning makes it possible to create a path towards high quality education in a systematic manner it allows for the structures and incentives within the education system to align to a focus on the child the implications are significant teacher education quality of continuing professional development and support systems will evolve according to the learning needs of students and performance measured against the trajectory of learning of his or her students this is a fundamental shift from current norms it will be difficult to implement but absolutely necessary for the learning goals to be achieved where teachers are not equipped to deal with poorly performing students the system should supplement with additional training and or teaching assistants successful models exist that provide teachers with supports for their in classroom practice some of which leverage internet social media and smartphones and other technologies in implementation of learner centred pedagogy students feedback should be taken into account when designing appropriate curricula and applying adequate teaching methods second student feedback should be taken into account systematically when designing appropriate curricula identifying pedagogical approaches and evaluating teachers principals and administrators as part of the learning assessment this feedback is rarely taken and if it is rarely factored into systemic reform research shows that students evaluations of their teachers can be as predictive as assessment of teacher quality based on standardized tests for example third pedagogical tools will need significant revision to cope with the changed metrics of the system there is very poor capacity within education systems in most countries to revise or create new appropriate tools building this capacity will be a central element of such an effort fourth curricula need to be paced and designed in keeping with childrens ability to learn recent studies point to the role of rushed and overambitious curricula in poor learning outcomes fifth budgets and by extension inputs of schooling will need to be modified based on what works best to help children learn sixth data on learning should be collected periodically more frequently than the national assessments and enough times that they give real information on how each child is progressing where learning trajectories are flat or too slow the system should receive enough information from schools to enable remedial action recommendation countries move towards flexible education systems especially beyond years of primary schooling where differentiated paces of learning are possible education systems are notoriously inflexible and should remain inflexible in granting equal access to the learning process and setting overall goals for learning achievement but much greater flexibility is required in how to get there many lessons can be learnt from the experience of alternate schooling systems over the past years some of these include children learn at different paces depending on their pre primary life experiences and training their parental guidance socio economic background and physical environment if there are predefined learning goals children should be allowed to learn at a differentiated pace within broad ranges children learn differently based on their cognitive skills experiences etc in some cases children do better with linear structured learning in other cases asynchronous learning works best a variety of pedagogical styles should be encouraged within the same system to allow for children to self pace and self learn but towards a high common standard of learning learning goals allow flexibility in timing of study this allows the system to open up to children who may not be able to attend the formal hours of time in school but who can be allowed space and structure to learn more slowly as appropriate for them without casting them out of the system altogether small groups with activity based instruction should supplement whole group instruction in such activities mixed ability grouping is found to be more effective than grouping that segregates children of different ability levels achieving target b through innovations in the delivery of education large education systems struggle with ensuring minimum performance standards this becomes more difficult when effective learning is brought in as a goal if governments are committed to improving learning outcomes then they may need to invest in different mechanisms of delivery the recommendations below highlight some emerging innovations that will help with this focus on learning goals at the national regional and individual level for all children recommendation the local community is a core partner in the delivery of education both through contributions in curriculum and pedagogical design and evaluations as well as structuring the delivery model itself most education systems are centrally designed with little room for local communities to provide inputs a focus on learning outcomes may allow for opening up the system to the local communities and parents of children to be part of the dialogue on how best to deliver education that creates the best learning environments for their children their inputs into pedagogical design i e through examples of local occupations community practices etc can contextualize learning and make it more immediately relevant for children and their families most countries have a rich tradition of native knowledge that is lost or excluded from the formal education system especially in the context of a broader set of learning skills such as those of physical well being social and emotional culture and the arts and literacy and communication parents and the local community can add to the content of learning as well as assess learning outcomes this is particularly challenging in the case of marginalized communities where parents may not be empowered to engage with teachers school principals and the administration on an equal footing opening up the learning domains has ancillary benefits for adult learning as well it can foster a culture of learning within the community and remove some of the social barriers to adult education in turn making them more involved parents at the same time parents and communities also need to be more aware of education rights and mobilize and advocate for greater accountability from the education system it is important to spread awareness of such rights that stem in part from the global goals that countries sign on to when the new sustainable development goals come into force there should be a major effort to popularize and spread ownership of the goals amongst parents and local communities so that the objectives of the goals inform the responsibilities of educators and parents action aid and the right to education project has created a charter of core rights for all schools to respect see box such efforts will be needed to popularize the sdgs and the responsibility of the schooling system in achieving them box empowering communities through rights the charter of rights defined by actionaid and the right to education project describes what an ideal school that offers quality education looks like it aims to support citizens perspectives to prepare local district and national reports on the state of education rights ultimately the purpose is to strengthen the public school system right to free and compulsory education there should be no charges direct or indirect for primary education education must gradually be made free at all levels right to non discrimination schools must not make any distinction in provision based on sex race colour language religion political opinion nationality ethnicity ability or any other status right to adequate infrastructure there should be an appropriate number of classrooms accessible to all with adequate and separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys schools should be built with local materials and be resilient to natural risks and disasters right to quality trained teachers schools should have a sufcient number of trained teachers of whom a good proportion are female teachers should receive good quality p re service and in service training with built in components on gender sensitivity non discrimination and human rights all teachers should be paid domestically competitive salaries right to safe and non violent environment children should be safe on route to and in school clear anti bullying policies and condential systems for reporting and addressing any form of abuse or violence should be in place right to relevant education the curriculum should not discriminate and should be relevant to the social cultural environmental economic and linguistic context of learners right to know your rights schools should teach human rights education and childrens rights in particular learning should include age appropriate and accurate information on sexual and reproductive rights right to participate girls and boys have the right to participate in decision making processes in school appropriate mechanisms should be in place to enable the full genuine and active participation of children right to transparent and accountable schools schools need to have transparent and effective monitoring systems both communities and children should be able to participate in accountable governing bodies management committees and parents groups right to quality learning girls and boys have a right to a quality learning environment and to effective teaching processes so that they can develop their personality talents and physical and mental abilities to their fullest potential source promoting rights in schools providing quality public education report by right to education project actionaid international recommendation the role of the teacher is re imagined and countries invest in teachers to succeed teachers are at the core of all systems of education eighty five percent of teachers in developing countries are categorized as trained though definitions and capacities are variable across countries in addition there is an overall shortfall of teachers of million with specifically million extra teachers needed in sub saharan africa where this need is the greatest two implications follow first despite the high proportion of officially trained teachers learning outcomes are poor and have not improved second the large number of new teachers needed across the developing world gives countries an opportunity to innovate around selection profiles selection criteria and training and support teacher motivation and teacher preparation for the task on hand in local circumstances are two key constraints in making the system learning outcome oriented not only do schools work in isolation from the surrounding community without involving parents in the process of education of their children but with urbanization reaching beyond the metros often teachers are not a part of the school community either there is a need to end the isolation of the school and there is a need to look into possibilities of creating community based learning mentors who support the work of expert teachers so that parents become a part of the teaching learning process the role of teachers in the coming decades will be significantly different from what it has been so far first their role as the custodians of knowledge is rapidly eroding knowledge is much more freely available than before and students have many ways to access it second their role as navigators of this knowledge as well as guides on interpreting and using it has become even more important the majority of teachers are not trained for this role yet it will be their greatest contribution in the future the curriculum for teacher education will need to reflect this fundamental shift their training will likewise need to adapt significantly to this end teachers at all levels of education must be appropriately trained and qualified teachers should continue their professional development upon recruitment through a period of induction into the profession with the support by a mentor and should have access throughout their careers to high quality continuous professional development and learning these opportunities should be provided by the public authorities or other employers at no cost to individual teachers recent efforts at pre service training that integrates classroom practice and in service professional development are positive steps in this direction teacher evaluation and incentives will also change with a focus on learning outcomes much more emphasis is needed on their ability to support children who are struggling their ability to close the learning gaps within the classroom and between grades and their ability to identify specific development needs within their student cohort the evidence on the link between teacher performance and monetary rewards is mixed low teachers salaries and delayed payments adversely affect the quality and performance of teachers but if salaries are above a threshold they cease to be a significant factor in performance training support an enabling environment and other similar factors determine performance the role of teachers as role models life guides motivators and as an inspiration for their students remains as important as ever but in order for them to fulfil their roles a serious investment will be needed to equip them for new challenges finally there is enormous scope to open up the role of teaching and bring in young people from colleges local communities and even retired persons to be part of the process of educating the next generation the teaching community can be expanded in innovative ways especially with the need for a set of skills that formal teacher training doesnt yet prepare it for recommendation use technology to open up the schooling system the promise of technology to transform education has not yet translated into reality efforts to deploy information and communications technology ict in education have had mixed results yet the potential of technology as not just an enabler but as a bridge to reach out to children and fundamentally alter the way education is delivered remains unparalleled the spread of mobile technology and broadband connectivity have together created a set of circumstances that did not exist even a few years ago thus making it very difficult to predict the effect of these changes first the improved quality for example in processing abilities and decreasing cost of end use devices ranging from desktop computers laptops netbooks tablets and smart phones have made them available to vast numbers of households making them economically competitive as an education delivery platform second the spread of broadband connectivity and cloud computing allow for centralized virtual centers of learning with much greater ease than before third improvements in learning software and instructional material have allowed for the possibility of multiple channels of learning fourth technology can remove geographic and time related restrictions on learning students can access teachers not just in their classes but anywhere in the world and at any time of the day creating for the first time the possibility of learning without walls and beyond the walls of the school as we know it at comparable quality finally the greatest gift of technology is that it is scalable and it is quick turning a large education system around takes years if not decades leaving at least a generation of learners behind technology offers the opportunity to bring about rapid improvements in learning outcomes for children it is an opportunity that all countries should recognize and experiment with the use of ict in education also demands that issue of equity of access to such technologies across the globe is resolved unless it is harnessed effectively and made available widely it will contribute to the growing gap between the wealthier and poorer societies throughout the world it is important to note that bringing in the necessary hardware will not change outcomes technology can only work if it is seen as a tool for improved pedagogy and teaching rather than an end itself it will require much greater research on how students across different socio economic groups engage with technology the costs of deployment and the ways in which it can be most effect to improve educational quality at scale for this reason at this stage there is no one model of technological success but greater innovation in this space has the potential to yield powerful results many of these possibilities are theoretical right now but there are multiple experiments underway that will over time change the way education is structured it is also premature to predict how technology will supplement modify or replace current models of formal schooling over the long run in the short run however there are two clear possibilities first technology can help reach children who are either outside of the schooling system or struggling within it second technology can immediately begin improving the quality of learning for students in school in both these cases children can benefit significantly and school systems should begin to research the best ways of using technology to achieve greater access and quality in learning recommendation the state leads on universalizing learning as the guarantor and primary provider of education but should engage on other channels of delivering education while the public sector is the mainstay of education delivery for the poorest children in the world the private sector is likely to continue to be a player in the delivery of educational content and services in most countries there are inherent challenges of equity with private provision of education yet its role in expanding access is a fact that has be dealt with given the diversity of non state actors engaged in the delivery of education its emergence itself as a significant player in the k delivery space is testament to the failure of the state in many countries to fulfil basic educational aspirations of children moving forward a focus on learning can clarify the relationship between the state and other providers of education the state has the primary responsibility for delivery of quality education to each and every child a comprehensive public delivery model of high quality education is the ideal to strive for the state is the only actor that can ensure equity of opportunity and access but it is not the only way in which education can be delivered by focusing on end outcomes of learning governments can open up various models of schools publicly financed and run publicly financed and privately run or community run schools others that are oriented around a consensus on national standards to ensure quality education for all in this case the governments role apart from its core responsibility of expanding access to equitable quality access can be to maintain fidelity to those learning goals and to ensure the financing provision regulation and standards of all education institutions as they work to achieve those goals in countries where the private sector is already a significant provider of basic education governments should ensure that it fulfils the goal of providing quality education so that that the poorest of the poor are able to receive the best available education regardless of whether or not it from public or private schools either through legislation or through voucher schemes or some combination thereof in countries where the quality differential between public and private providers is significant or where students supplement learning through private tuitions the only long term solution is to reduce the quality gap as discussed above in the short term a focus on bringing quality education to the most vulnerable and deprived children who cannot afford private tuitions is one way of reducing the inequities in the system innovations in technology for education are likely to emerge from within technology companies identifying ways of working with technology providers to create appropriate learning material teacher training material assessments and delivery mechanisms can be used to target the poorest and promote access and equity finally designing a curriculum that prepares high school students for work will require working closely with industry and working in partnership with it to identify necessary skills for employment recommendation measure what we recognize recognize what we cannot measure how educational systems will evolve will depend in many ways on what they measure we know now that access and equity matter the education for all goals and the millennium development goals helped identify specific indicators that would track how countries performed on both variables and country efforts closely tracked those indicators in chapter we have identified indicators that will help track if governments are meeting their commitments to deliver quality education to their children it is equally necessary to understand that there are important unknowns that we cannot yet measure despite years of research and analysis we dont perfectly understand the alchemy that distinguishes a good learning experience from a poor one we attribute teacher quality early childhood preparation parental influence pedagogical tools infrastructural factors and curriculum design to creating this mix in different magnitudes but the learning production function is not fully understood yet recent efforts in this context are beginning to yield rich data for example through the use of direct observation tools for example classroom assessment scoring systems caregiver interaction scale etc these tools are able to capture the social and emotional climate of classrooms and teaching and not just cognitive instruction most countries struggle to fit children of different abilities and backgrounds into a common classroom setting despite years of such struggles there is very poor understanding of how cognitive variation within a cohort can be brought to a common standard or indeed if that is possible for children with widely varying learning experiences specifically for children that are behind grade levels as compared to their cohort average what are the best strategies for closing that gap to what extent can such gaps be closed and how should such efforts be prioritized most education proponents including the authors of this report believe implicitly in the ability of children to learn at all ages from all circumstances but more research is needed to document and systematize the evidence around these abilities finally are there ways of teaching children the full set of skills that they need different from the way schools are currently structured we return to this theme repeatedly in this report not because the current structure of schooling is necessarily ineffective but because it is too large to change direction quickly while we focus on improving the current systems to not consider other ways of delivering education would be a grave injustice to children currently in low quality schools across much of the developing world we owe it to them to encourage countries to innovate especially for the children who are at margins of our society and in whose investment countries face the greatest challenges preparing children and adults for work what do young boys and girls do after graduating from secondary school in what ways do the years spent in the schooling system prepare these boys and girls to become productive valued members of their society what accounts for the steep drop in enrolments at the tertiary level the majority of young people in developing countries do not have access to institutions of tertiary learning that have been shown to correlate strongly to improved skills and earning potential even after school they do not have pathways to decent sustainable work at a living wage this section examines the role of tertiary education in those pathways and the challenges of lifelong learning achieving target c through school to work transitions and vocational programs how young girls and boys make the transition from life as a full time student to life as a full time worker determines their career trajectory yet this path or multiple paths is not well understood or documented especially for the developing world the best evidence is from developed countries where the education system is able to retain most students through secondary school and which have structured systems to guide students through this change towards formal employment for most young people in developing countries there is no clear structural break between work and study a small proportion continues to the formal tertiary sector and formal labour markets many work while they study through high school almost all do so in the informal economy and in their communities and on their farms where the quality of schooling does not offer new opportunities many gravitate naturally to their part time work which then converts to full time work for many in rural areas migration to cities offers the promise of a wider variety of work though often in poor conditions and at low wages most young people either work on farm land or for small and medium enterprises start small informal businesses of their own or join small family owned units or work as casual labour in larger organizations these are for most part forced choices and do not allow students to leverage their years of study or the timing of their transition to work to improve their quality of life several factors create this challenge the informality of the economy means that potential employers are not organized in ways that can interact with schools directly workers in the informal economy lack agency and control over their work conditions even if they are reasonably educated even in the organized sector employers are not connected to the schooling system or focused on providing the best opportunities for young graduates there is huge information asymmetry students have little knowledge or guidance on work opportunities after school there are few opportunities to develop local work in the community and most governments are unable to design transition programs that sort for the two parallel and often overlapping needs to prepare students for tertiary education or to enable them to work on their terms there are different models of successful school to work and vocational programs in the developed world germany switzerland japan finland among others they are designed differently but have some common elements that make them function well and have important lessons for other countries it is important to note that this transition is difficult it depends not just on the quality of primary and secondary schooling but on labour markets on macroeconomic conditions and on the institutional design of the program itself all countries even the best performing ones struggle with maintaining effective transition programs as these conditions change the successful ones are able to adapt quickly to changing economic needs and keep the interests of students at the core of their programs recommendation countries integrate vocational training into high school curriculum including a component of full time work successful school to work programs all over the world begin at the high school level not after it while students are in the years age group they are exposed to rigorous vocational education sometimes as a compulsory subject sometimes as a separate track this recognizes the reality that not all high school students will study further and that for many professions they do not need to further all successful vocational programs have a component of full time work for part of the program this requires a tie in with industry for placements ensuring that the curriculum remains relevant but also exposes students to rigors of full time work and is an essential to preparing them for work and for life recommendation academic and vocational tracks have multiple bridge points to students to cross over during high school and undergraduate programs successful school to work programs recognize that choosing between vocational and academic tracks is difficult for young people and that these choices may change as economic and employment opportunities change if these systems are designed as entirely separate students will select the ones with lowest risk and higher social value even if these are not helpful in making the transition to work all successful programs incentivize students to both tracks by offering at various stages after school after undergraduate degrees etc the opportunity to switch tracks such switches are contingent on performance but their presence in the design of academic and vocational programs is a critical element in attracting students to all tracks of study and lowering the costs of that choice such programs also succeed in integrating literacy math and science applied to specific vocational courses recommendation schools and colleges have career counselling and guidance for students and communication and education for parents successful transition programs offer students and parents help in navigating the options for their future in the case of developing countries it is even more critical that students receive information and help in understanding the implications of their choices since they often do not have access to general information about the economy location of different types of work and training requirements in different professions japan offers the best example of this kind of help where teachers are directly responsible for developing links with employers and for mentoring students through their work experiences in developing countries high school teachers can form similar links with local industry the local community and with potential employers in the informal economy schools can work with parents and communities to identify social needs that can be fulfilled by young people and advise them on how working to fill such needs can be done in ways that allow young people to be economically stable recommendation schools and colleges invest in high quality and relevant training in all cases where school to work transition programs work the content of the education is extremely high quality and relevant both for potential employers and for students in developing countries this challenge is even greater since the foundational skills of students are typically weaker the realities of local economies point to specific elements in the curriculum that may not be as relevant for the developed world localized entrepreneurship skills for example these skills should encompass not just technical knowledge but skills on organizing building and managing communities identifying local needs and fulfilling those needs and fostering creativity leadership and innovation in students to solve their own problems finally attempts at transition programs fail if they are not continually updated in line with the changing requirements a regular revision of the program is an essential element of all successful transition programs recommendation formal vocational schemes are jointly designed with governments and with manufacturing and services industries successful school to work and vocational programs are those where the design is done jointly by the government and industry in cases where industry is the primary initiator programs are less successful this is because companies do not have incentives to prioritize student training and recruitment neither do they have the ability or need to identify broader skills requirements for students outside of their own specific needs governments are traditionally poor at designing such programs in isolation simply because they lack real time market intelligence on jobs the best performing systems across all developed countries are those where government guides students and sets the frame for engagement with industry and where industry guides the curriculum and pedagogical design allowing market dynamics to document policy action will continue to facilitate transition to work and reduce youth unemployment and frictional unemployment more broadly policy innovation in skills development that involves a wide participatory process of governments private sector operators and stakeholders is more likely to contribute to inclusive market growth while governments will continue to play a primary role in education policy formulation and in designing the architecture of national qualifications systems markets can make a substantial contribution to empowerment and mobility of the labour force through informal skills development should such learning alternatives be recognized by the former recommendation national frameworks to recognize informal alternative skills development poorly performing public vocational programs and a skills mismatch have not prevented businesses from growing and increasing their competitiveness in the marketplace to overcome labour productivity shortfalls due to insufficient or absent relevant skills firms have started to use informal skill development more than the formal alternative finding that outcomes of the former are increasingly better peer learning and on the job training will remain significant considering that over of the current labour force will continue to be in the labour market for the next years thus representing a remarkable source of knowledge and skills national qualifications frameworks and formal training organizations have not yet found ways to recognize informal skills and this hurts the mobility of the informally trained labour force if private investment in informal skills development in all companies and in smes in particular is formally recognized it will increase labour mobility and allow individual career progression with informal skills treated as both work experience and learning processes policy makers employers and employees organizations should work together to build bridges between informal skills development and formal training programmes while recognizing informal skills in the national qualifications frameworks achieving target c by matching skills with emerging sustainable development needs tertiary education systems across the developing world have focused on the formal economy and have been poor at predicting and preparing for its economic and employment needs nearly percent of all unemployed youth in low income countries are estimated to have a college degree yet they are inadequately trained to do available jobs after poor school education it becomes much harder to prepare young people for highly skilled work yet it is important to remember that formal manufacturing and service sector jobs are not the mainstay of employment or earning capacities especially in developing countries there are many other ways of matching skills to work that needs to be done in society first it is clear that increasing mechanization will change the kind of work that is available in capital intensive manufacturing the implications of this are not clearly recognized at this stage but low skill manufacturing is likely to see a fall in labour intensity this means that a traditional area of employment in manufacturing is shrinking rapidly this is also one that currently employs the largest proportion of the medium to low skilled labour force this is a serious challenge to labour markets and a serious policy debate is needed to question whether such a shift towards automation is inevitable or socially desirable second there are many areas in the informal and social economy where important social work requires skills to serve those needs these include self employment on farms small entrepreneurships farm based cooperative and producer organizations localized services for water and energy supply services such as care for the elderly and infirm community health worker needs management of local forests and water bodies etc many of these are not monetized or seen as viable avenues of professional work for young people with the appropriate skills sets and dialogue within communities there are ways of ensuring that these social needs can be met and that young people can earn economically sustainable livelihoods through them recommendation countries match skills production with emerging economic and social needs starting with specific sectors and design systems of continual engagement with potential employers the macroeconomic profile of a country its key industries and the extent of labour intensity of those industries will help determine the industry specific skills that a country needs estimates indicate that by there will be a percent shortfall in medium skilled workers in low income countries translating into million workers this is likely to correspond to a surplus of million low skilled workers globally more than half will be in low income countries on the supply side the developing world has seen a structural shift since when percent of jobs were in the farming sector today that ratio is reversed with over a billion jobs having been created in non farm sectors these jobs reflect structural shifts in their economies middle income and bric countries have seen dramatic shifts away from agriculture to services and manufacturing tertiary education systems in low income countries need to prepare for these shifts by working both with potential employers and with local communities to identify emerging needs second the instructional material needs to keep pace with the demands of industry and societal needs so that graduates are aware and capable to responding to their work requirements third countries need to value their young people and invest in creating hospitable decent and high quality living conditions for them recommendation countries promote skills that enable young women and men to earn livelihoods in the informal and care economies with decent working conditions and living wages over percent of the labour force in developing countries work in the informal sector or are self employed such graduates are either employed by unregulated small and medium enterprises or are self employed the tertiary sector in most countries does not prepare students for informal or self employed work skills in opening and running small businesses basic accounting management it and communication skills would allow young graduates to access capital and build their own enterprises at a much larger scale and with greater efficiency than they are in a position to do skills in social areas such as improved farming negotiating with consumers creating value by preserving local environmental assets helping the local community manage its resources and creating services for households with care needs can create sustainable long term work more effort is needed in understanding how such work can be compensated and supported by the government and private individuals recommendation countries invest in creating human resources for sustainable development over the next several decades the world will face significant development challenges already the needs are staggering the world needs an incremental million schoolteachers of which million are needed in sub saharan africa who estimates an additional million community health workers will be needed in priority countries alone to enable them to achieve the millennium development goals similar gaps exist in the case of urban planners water and sanitation experts climate change experts agricultural extension workers and scientists epidemiologists energy scientists transportation planners engineers etc in a rapidly changing world there is a huge paucity of skills on managing the transition of societies from rural to urban poor to middle and high income agricultural to service and manufacturing based in the context of climate change and sustainability issues developing countries have the numbers of young people needed to fill these roles but they are not trained in such capacities as yet recommendation invest in training for a green economy sustainable development will require choosing more inclusive and responsible business models to secure a better future for the global ecosystem transformations in production to reduce resource intensity fuel source etc and in production to improve health preserve the quality of the environment and to sustain growth will demand changes in skills that the education system will need to deliver countries need to begin planning to alter education and training content in keeping with the greening process of the global economy such complex transformations will need to go hand in hand with improvements in the capacity of new markets to serve the poor education and training for the new green culture should also target the lower yields of the income pyramid where greening practices are simply too expensive to be considered right now recommendation countries invest in continuing education for adult women and men extending adult literacy to all women and men is a first priority of all governments literacy is not just about the acquisition and use of reading writing and numeracy skills its direct consequence is the ability of adults to be active citizens to have much greater voice and agency over their own lives to improve their health their livelihoods and to fight discrimination in all forms the goals of literacy programmes should reflect this understanding further literacy should be seen as a continuous process that requires sustained learning and application all policies and programmes should be defined to encourage sustained participation and celebrate progressive achievement rather than focusing on one off provision with a single end point adult learning programs when designed with a clear link to empowerment have been shown to be much more effective the reflect program for example is one such effort and evaluations show that literacy achievement through this program has been double that of traditional programs as measured in el salvador bangladesh and uganda other consequences were seen in gender roles improving health and hygiene increasing school enrolment especially of girls strengthening productivity e g diversifying crops increasing cooperative practices and increasing peoples involvement in and control over community development programmes recommendation countries invest in adult learning and skill building opportunities to strengthen the capacity of caregivers and communities to support healthy child development and create the next generation of learners as was outlined in chapter young children need to have skilled and capable adults present in their lives on a consistent basis in order to provide appropriate enrichment opportunities and protection against severe adversity that are essential for healthy brain development three areas of adult capability that stand out as important particularly in buffering children and building effective coping skills in the face of high levels of stress are executive function and self regulation skills caregiver mental health and family economic stability at the moment there is a need for increasing investment in testing interventions in these areas that explicitly address how these capacities not only help adults succeed in the workforce and as citizens but also in fostering a healthy next generation of learners the role of universities in developing countries universities have traditionally played three roles in developing countries first as centers of knowledge production and dissemination across a range of subjects ranging from natural sciences to economic and social issues to the expansion and the creation of the arts second as creators of high skilled individuals contributing to national and the global economy and third as the sources for human resources and knowledge for nation building for example in areas of agriculture medicine urban planning etc there are five broad structural variations in such institutions first research universities typically public and a few in number that focus on basic knowledge creation provincial or regional colleges that typically produce the majority of undergraduates in the country professional colleges that specialize in specific typically high skill occupations vocational colleges and distance learning institutions in most developing countries research universities colleges and distance learning institutions have been publicly funded and provided while professional and vocational institutions typically have a mix of public and private participation universities across the developing world are facing similar circumstances first despite islands of excellence in some countries on average universities are not comparable to developed country universities based on standards parameters of the quality of the research being produced and the teaching of the top universities less than percent are from developing countries in of the top countries that applied for patents only were developing countries india and china this picture is likely to change in the future as china in particular and emerging economies in general invests significantly in research and development r d but for most countries in sub saharan africa latin america and south asia there will be a huge difference in quality relative to global top performers second there is a trend towards privatization of higher education across the developing world latin america and asia demonstrate this trend where private enrolments have surged in the past decades part of this trend is a response to burgeoning demand enrolments in developing countries have increased percent over the past decade with the fastest growth in east asia and the pacific followed by south and west asia and latin america and the caribbean part of the trend is recognition of the individual returns to certain kinds of higher education where the value of professional degrees can be quantified based on employment opportunities available afterwards part of the trend is because government funding to higher education has simply not kept pace with the increase in enrolments increased privatization brings its own set of challenges the need to ensure quality to manage the inequality that between elite private institutions and lower quality public institutions and promote national research priorities third cross border flows of knowledge students and teachers are accelerating rapidly online education is spreading quickly across developed and developing countries and while there are many questions on how virtual education will work it is clear that traditional models of instruction will change in the three years since the advent of the massive open online courses moocs these courses are already garnering hundreds of thousands of students a feat which took the largest traditional distance and open education universities decades to achieve technological advancement offers the opportunity of reducing costs and increasing access at a scale that was not possible before students in developing countries are likely to benefit the most from access to high quality courses but there are clear cost and access benefits for students in the developed countries as well both students and faculty are mobile with the institutions that are capable of offering the best research facilities peer group and teaching able to attract the students and teachers from around the world finally the demographic transition is ensuring that the largest population cohorts in developing countries will be those in the years age group over eighty percent of them have not had access to high quality tertiary education and yet their ability to earn and be productive will depend on acquiring new skills and upgrading their current ones institutions of higher learning will need to offer ways for adults to re engage with the learning process either through distance education or part time courses or specialized short term programs technology can be a valuable enabler in this regard but the structure of education needs to reflect and respond to this need so that women and men and access the tertiary education system throughout their lives japan is an example of a country with a well functioning lifelong learning program where its goal is to create an enriching and dynamic society in the st century forming a lifelong learning society in which people can freely choose learning opportunities at any time during their lives and in which proper recognition is accorded to those learning achievements there are many aspects of higher education that developing countries need to deal with a full discussion of all of them is outside of the scope of this report in the next section recommendations that would support an expansion of higher education to promote lifelong learning and to meet the needs of a sustainable society are discussed recommendation governments support universities to prioritize research based solutions for sustainable development as a core purpose universities are in a unique position to support society in evidence based scientific solutions to the problems of sustainable development cutting edge research on issues of climate change solutions for adaptation and mitigation alternate energy sources public health challenges emerging from rising temperatures management of water resources and ecosystems are being led by academic institutions today it is however concentrated in a few universities solutions for the complex interrelated ecological social and economic problems that societies will face will need to be developed locally it is imperative that universities and research centers in developing countries claim the space of high quality locally relevant research that will offer solutions to the cities and countries they are in this will require prioritizing national and regional issues of ecology demographic change urbanization public health energy research and climatology within research as well as developing mechanisms for engaging with policy makers communities and private companies to create application based practical solutions recommendation countries create enabling regulatory frameworks that encourage public sector led growth of higher education in collaboration with the private sector the public sector has a pivotal role in promoting basic research and knowledge production through high quality research universities this role needs to be strengthened and funded adequately however it is clear that the public sector alone cannot meet the demands of higher education it is important therefore to create an enabling regulatory framework that encourages the private sector to invest in higher education in the long run not just in short term profitable professional courses but in creating a large number of centers of excellence in different fields of research and expanding basic undergraduate and graduate programs to greater numbers of young people a range of institutional designs from private philanthropy led endowment based universities to other non profit and for profit institutions will be needed to meet the academic and professional needs of students regulatory structures will need to allow for this kind of institutional diversity and reward quality and innovation and create avenues through advisory councils of science that can channel the research into practical applications the public sector also has an important responsibility to ensure equitable access to higher education and therefore affordability across public and private institutions recommendation academic institutions use technology to expand access promote affordability and allow for lifelong learning the expansion of higher education has simply not kept pace with demand new institutions require large investments and building a strong faculty takes time technology can be a powerful tool for expanding access more rapidly and doing so at a significantly lower marginal cost internet connectivity is still poor in most low income countries but it is expanding very quickly over the next decade and a half it is entirely possible that most large urban centers and a significant proportion of rural areas have access to broadband in that case blended programs of learning can allow for a much faster expansion of higher education countries have already begun to move in this direction examples include nigeria china india increasing access is important not just for school graduates but also for adults looking to learn new skills and competencies universities have to prepare themselves to provide lifelong learning to their adult populations technology allows this through online courses and if needed specialized mid career programs investing in such programs will allow for a continuous improvement of workforce productivity at a relatively low cost recommendation universities across countries collaborate on research and teaching with the free flow of knowledge across borders there is great scope for cross border collaboration between universities such collaborations make sense on several counts it will allow universities to retain and build their faculty by providing a varied and rich peer network without physical relocation it will allow for joint funding for common research questions joint programs of study will give students exposure to other student groups and teachers in different cultural context it will enable a faster spread of better research and teaching practices and allow leapfrogging in academic practices between established and new institutions conclusion future research needs the previous chapters laid out the imperatives for investing in high quality education systems across all age groups to create a sustainable society in this chapter we identify areas of future research that will help countries identify ways in which education can contribute to sustainable development determinants of learning for all ages different contexts and backgrounds components of effective remedial programs on a large scale for children steeped in poor learning environments technological capabilities for self learning appropriate and effective ict interventions effective roles and training for teachers for learning goals appropriate standards of curriculum for different stages of learning ways of integrating traditional and local knowledge into school and college curricula role of communities in educating children governing schools monitoring learning outcomes skills school to work programs for informal workers and entrepreneurship skills financial models for work around sustainable development needs in local communities additional costs reallocation of resources for investing in learning outcomes annex sdsn indicator report extract the following is an excerpt from the forthcoming report on designing sustainable development goals targets and indicators a report by the leadership council of the sustainable development solutions network which outlines a recommended indicator framework for the post goal framework the leadership council of the sustainable development solutions network sdsn launched the action agenda for sustainable development on june the report maps out operational priorities for the post development agenda it proposes goals and targets that might replace the millennium development goals after their expiration in late this report outlines a possible indicator framework to accompany sustainable development goals sdgs and targets as outlined in the report many gaps will need to be filled by september to enable an effective sdg monitoring and management framework this report seeks to help inform these important discussions and will be revised periodically we welcome comments and suggestions that should be addressed to info unsdsn org since the intergovernmental processes including the open working group on the sdgs have yet to agree on a small number of goals and targets this report is organized around the goals and targets proposed by the sdsn the indicators contained in this report map well against the focus areas currently under discussion in the open working group once a clear consensus has emerged on the structure of the post goals and targets the indicator framework outlined in this working draft will be adjusted accordingly the report is organized as follows the main report outlines the rationale and criteria for indicators including suggestions for how the data might be collected a first table summarizes the proposed indicators and the suggested tier indicators it is followed by a second table that outlines how indicators for crosscutting thematic issues such as gender equality or sustainable consumption and production are arranged across the goals annex outlines suggested principles for setting goals targets and indicators which is also available as a stand alone document annex describes each core indicator in detail defines suggested tier indicators and shows how indicators work across goals finally annex lists frequently asked questions that complement the faq in the action agenda and on our website before turning to the specifics of indicators for the sdgs it is useful to make a few overarching points first the suggestions in this report remain in an early stage we are looking for comments and creativity to improve and complete them second because of the millennium development goals mdgs process the international public subsequently minor revisions to the targets have been published on the sdsn website the report is available atwww unsdsn org resources see http unsdsn org wp content uploads mapping sdsn indicators to owg focus areas pdf for a mapping of the indicators contained in this report against the focus areas of the open working group as of april we will update this comparison as the discussions in the open working group advance reporting on poverty related indicators tends to be more developed than on other social and environmental indicators in many cases new indicators will have to be developed together with information gathering systems to cover new priorities this will require major investments in national and international capacity to collect and synthesize data third in view of the novelty of many of these indicators the sdsn proposes to work with international institutions and other organizations during to discuss the development relevance accuracy appropriateness and realism of the recommended indicators in some cases what we are suggesting will not be possible to implement in a timely and accurate manner in other cases additional indicators may need to be considered decisions on what can actually be measured should be advised by the relevant expert communities with the advice and leadership of the global institutions charged with oversight measurement standards and implementation of programs fourth the proposed indicator framework comprises a limited number of core indicators to track the broad agenda of sustainable development and ensure coherence of efforts comments received during the public consultation of an earlier version of the report confirm that core indicators is the upper limit of what the international system can report on under the sdgs of course such a global indicator framework will and must not replace the much more detailed operational reporting in key areas e g biodiversity under the aichi targets malaria control programs education indicators under efa in many instances governments such as local authorities and other stakeholders require detailed geospatially disaggregated information and other real time which is not provided by a set of global indicators the sdsn is exploring with other partners how these important components of a data revolution could become part of a post monitoring framework similarly the indicators will not replace organizational metrics including key performance indicators for businesses the sdsn will work with business organizations to explore how available business metrics might be adapted to support a global sdg indicator framework fifth and finally initiation and implementation of any new information system will take time lead agencies should start preparing their information gathering systems as soon as possible in anticipation of the goals and indicators that will be adopted in september the first sdg report and review can thereby commence in the economic and social council ecosoc in the summer of by at the latest we would hope that the international system and notably the un organizations and partner institutions including the oecd world bank world trade organization and others would have in place an accurate meaningful annual reporting system we underscore that this will require enhanced support to statistical offices and systems in many countries so that high quality data can be collected in a timely manner sdg indicators the purpose of sdg indicators is twofold first an indicator should be a management tool to help countries develop implementation and monitoring strategies for achieving the sdgs and to monitor progress second an indicator is a report card to measure progress towards achieving a target and ensure the accountability of governments and other stakeholders for achieving the sdgs often multiple indicators are used for each target where possible objective quantitative metrics are used these are complemented with experiential metrics from household and other forms of surveys as well as subjective or perception based indicators based on expert judgments or peoples perceptions while there have been great improvements in data gathering the mdg indicators have not fully fulfilled their dual purpose because the data come with too great a time lag to be useful in management and accountability often the mdg indicators arrive with a lag of three or more years which is not useful for real time management data from national statistical systems and household surveys is often incomplete and of poor quality much greater investment in building national statistical capacities strengthening quality and standards will be required for the sdg indicators to fulfill both key functions international agencies rely in part on primary data produced by the statistical system of each country involvement and cooperation between international agencies and national statistical offices nsos was also missed by the mdg process and must be strengthened for the sdgs similarly the capacities of nsos were not strengthened adequately to ensure effective real time monitoring of the mdgs all of this will require investing in national statistical systems household surveys remote sensing and big data identifying areas where statistical standards are currently lacking and asking the statistical community to develop them in the future thinking in terms of the measurement instruments that each country should have in place e g vital statistics censuses surveys national accounts administrative records big data and specifying the quality requirements e g frequency of data collection timeliness of releases geographical detail and common set of variables available for cross classification purposes ideally the national sdg indicators should operate on an annual cycle which could follow this schedule for example at the start of each new calendar year one or more specialized agencies gather the national data to complete the national accounts on that indicator no later than april of the new year the national tables are then forwarded to the international organization or organizations tasked with preparing the annual sdg report this agency or agencies would have six weeks to compile and prepare the draft report of the preceding years data the draft report would be presented at the un to the secretary general sg and the president of the general assembly pga in early june for a final review and a cover statement the report would be prepared for publication by end june to be available to the ecosoc ministerial meetings in july august in september october the report will be finalized with corrected and updated data and the final report posted online this approach is ambitious and will obviously push all countries and participating organizations hard but the goal will be to turn the sdg indicators into useful tools for real time national and sub national management this monitoring cycle will be unattainable without dedicated financing to improve the statistical infrastructure and capacity of each country as highlighted by the un statistics division the main challenge is that the required capacity to measure the full range of sustainable development indicators currently does not exist in most countries in the absence of adequate financing we will have goals that cannot be used and a process without adequate results in our ict connected world the aim for real time data used for real time management should be an essential and necessary component of the sdg era in addition to national level reporting of sdg indicators data should also be collected and reported sub nationally e g for cities and states provinces geospatial data needs to complement the headline indicators identified in this report ideally the schedule for sub national reporting would track the international schedule for harmonized country reporting since a very large number of indicators would be required to comprehensively track progress towards all targets we propose that countries consider two sets of indicators a first set of core indicators would be applicable to every country and track the most essential dimensions of the targets a second set of tier indicators would track issues that may be applicable to some countries only such as indicators for neglected tropical diseases ntds or that may give countries greater scope in applying complex concepts such as inequality to their specific needs the tier indicators represent a menu of options for countries to choose from though the list we include is far from exhaustive building upon the criteria proposed in the united nations development group undg handbook we propose that robust sdg indicators should to the greatest extent possible be clear and straightforward indicators need to be simple to compile and interpret un statistical division compendium of statistical notes for the open working group on sustainable development goals owg paragraph available here http sustainabledevelopment un org content documents compendium of statistical notes pdf united nations indicators for monitoring the millennium development goals definitions rationale concepts and sources new york ny united nations consensus based in line with international standards core indicators in particular should be underpinned by a broad international consensus on their measurement and be based on international standards recommendations and best practices to facilitate international comparison broadly consistent with systems based information to ensure coherence indicators should be broadly consistent with systems of national accounts systems of environmental economic accounting and other systems based information constructed from well established data sources indicators should draw on well established sources of public and private data and be consistent to enable measurement over time disaggregated preference should be given to indicators that lend themselves to disaggregation by i characteristics of the individual or household e g gender age income disability religion race or ethnicity ii economic activity and iii spatial disaggregation e g by metropolitan areas urban and rural or districts as the high level panel of eminent persons on the post agenda report recommends targets can only be considered achieved if they are met for all relevant groups universal the set of sdg indicators as a whole needs to track a universal agenda many though not all core indicators should therefore be applicable in developed as well as developing countries managed by a designated organization each core indicator should be managed by one or more designated lead organization s that will be responsible for annual high quality national reporting of the indicator with due consideration to cost effectiveness lean reporting processes and national monitoring methods we recognize that in many cases countries will augment the global list of indicators with their own national indicators we strongly encourage this kind of localization or contextualization of the indicators especially since many sdgs are inherently local in orientation in the first table below we present possible indicators to cover the sdgs and targets we also identify the most likely lead organization or organizations for the specific indicator as well as the current status of the indicator in many cases especially for poverty and economic indicators the variables are already collected e g as part of the mdg process in some cases however the collection and reporting cycle is over several years as with global poverty data the sdsn will consult with relevant institutions during to determine the feasibility of an annual data cycle for each indicator for most of the social environmental and governance indicators however the international system does not collect these indicators on a routine harmonized and international we recommend that the disaggregation by age should at a minimum be by the following set of groups years infants years pre school age years school age years childbearing age years working ages and years and older elderly persons for example water use should be accounted for by economic activity using international standard industrial classification of all economic activities isic high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda a new global partnership eradicate poverty and transform economies through sustainable development united nations publishing basis therefore national statistical offices and the international organizations would have to be equipped and supported to take on these new data challenges and responsibilities as emphasized throughout this will also require substantial investments in national statistical systems the final point before turning to the tables is that the sdsn is not recommending at this stage detailed technical definitions of the indicators that would be premature we recommend a broad public discussion and further dialogue with international agencies as well as national statistical offices that will likely be responsible for indicator collection and reporting in such a process we fully expect that other indicators may be considered and technical specifications be determined preliminary and incomplete suggestions for sdg indicators potential and illustrative indicator goal end extreme poverty including hunger potential

greenhouse pollutant emissions with potential indicators references foreword working for a better world health equity cannot be concerned only with health seen in isolation rather it must come to grips with the larger issue of fairness and justice in social arrangements including economic allocations paying appropriate attention to the role of health in human life and freedom health equity is most certainly not just about the distribution of health not to mention the even narrower focus on the distribution of health care amartya sen the collective efforts of the global community towards ending extreme poverty and hunger and to promote gender equality were successfully directed by the millennium declaration and the millennium development goals mdgs the importance of health as a key feature of human development was recognized with three mdgs explicitly linked to health indicators and the others structured around major determinants of health while considerable health gains have been achieved through the mdgs there needs to be a continued commitment for accelerating progress related to those goals many of which will not be achieved by epidemiological and demographic transitions accompanied by changing exposures to risk factors have brought forth non communicable diseases as major global contributors to preventable death and disability at the same time health inequities have persisted within populations despite improvement in aggregate national health indicators there is also a concern that segmentation into specific age or risk groups such as childhood and pregnancy misses critical periods of life like adolescence a critical period as it lays the foundation for adult health similarly the health needs of the elderly must also be addressed the fifteen year period of mdgs will end in in the rio summit further resolved to put an end to extreme poverty and hunger by placing poverty reduction in the broader context of sustainable development the summits final outcome was the call for new sustainable development goals sdgs to be adopted by the united nations un post these sdgs will set global priorities for action and promote sustainable and equitable development worldwide while continuing the commitments to the millennium development goals mdgs set in the sdgs will provide a framework for integrating actions across multiple sectors to enable human development to proceed in a manner that optimizes the equitable use of planetary resources whilst minimizing threats to sustainability the sustainable development solutions network sdsn the sdsn was launched in august under the auspices of un secretary general ban ki moon as part of his efforts to promote sustainable development the sdsn mobilizes global scientific and technological knowledge to address the challenges of sustainable development the sdsn is an independent body of multidisciplinary and multi institutional experts from different sectors relevant to the sdgs the sdsn was mandated to i assist the un process by providing well argued evidence informed and succinctly summarized policy briefs which would flow to the high level panel of eminent persons the un secretary generals office and to the member states of the un engaged in the inter governmental process of defining the sdgs ii to identify and evaluate innovative solutions that will overcome barriers to the attainment of those goals and accelerate progress towards sustainable development at the global level and iii to enlist and strengthen universities and institutions in different countries regions that can become catalysts and enablers of transformational processes leading to sustainable development especially through the design delivery and evaluation of innovative solutions the sdsn has established thematic groups tgs comprising leading scientists engineers academics and practitioners from civil society and the business community to promote solutions to the key challenges of sustainable development a leadership council oversees the work of the un sdsn health has been a prominent focus area of the sdsn the thematic group on health for all has been discussing the priorities and position of health in the post development agenda the mandate of the tg on health is to prepare a more detailed document amplifying the evidence for goals prioritized by the sdsn and profiling the intersection of those goals with other development goals for submission to the un this paper to continue to engage with the un process for framing the post sdgs on health between september and september identify and appraise innovations of transformational value in advancing the health mdgs and future sdgs with an emphasis on both health system interventions and multi sectoral initiatives to work with the leadership council of the sdsn in building and strengthening institutional networks that will align with and assist in the implementation of the sdgs in the post phase of global development the tg on health for all aims to review the global evidence related to health and its relevance to sustainable development link health to the social and environmental determinants influenced by other sectors and identify pathways by which universal access to health can be advanced across the world through this effort the tg aims to assist in the vision for a better world in the st century wherein all people on earth can benefit from the fruits of sustainable development and lead long and productive lives enriched by health and wellbeing at all ages executive summary the framework for sustainable development in the st century must maximize healthy wellbeing at all ages through universal health coverage and pro health policies in all sectors adopting a life course approach that will benefit all persons we recommend the health goal achieve health and wellbeing at all ages to accomplish this objective we propose that all countries achieve universal health coverage at every stage of life with particular emphasis on primary health services including mental and reproductive health to ensure that all people receive quality health services without suffering financial hardship countries implement policies to create enabling social and environmental conditions that promote the health of populations and help individuals make healthy and sustainable decisions related to their daily living health is crucial for sustainable human development both as an inalienable human right and an essential contributor to the economic growth of society health is also a good summative measure of the progress of nations in achieving sustainable development it contributes to national development through productive employment reduced expenditure on illness care and greater social cohesion by promoting good health at all ages the benefits of development extend across generations investments in primary health care can promote health across all social groups and reduce health inequities within and between countries improving performance of health systems by enhancing financial and human resources appropriate use of technology community empowerment and good governance will advance this agenda the potential for providing large scale employment as frontline health workers particularly to women and young persons should be utilized to strengthen the economy and improve health services we believe that universal health coverage uhc delivered through an adequately resourced and well governed health system will be capable of addressing these and other health challenges especially if supported by policies in other sectors which promote health and environmental sustainability and reduce poverty universal health coverage must ensure equitable access to affordable accountable appropriate health services of assured quality to all people these must include promotive preventive curative palliative and rehabilitative services this includes public health services such as infectious disease monitoring and ensuring food safety they must be supported by policies and services addressing the wider social and environmental determinants of health for individuals and populations governments must play the role of both guarantor and enabler mobilizing all relevant societal resources for the delivery of health services national commitment to universal health coverage must be legally embedded in a rights based framework since the determinants of health extend across multiple sectors the post development agenda must promote synergies and partnerships that align actions for better health improved health of individuals and populations will also help in achieving other development goals such as poverty reduction gender empowerment and universal education several common determinants also link health to the environment agriculture and food systems water and energy security urban development and transport trade and investment communications and human migration apart from intrinsic value of health uhc can create positive externalities for development womens empowerment and gender equity and social solidarity within the health sector primary health care should be accorded the highest importance because of its ability to provide maximum health benefits to all parts of society and to ensure sustainable health care expenditure levels we recommend the following actions be undertaken at global and national levels to achieve health and wellbeing at all ages build on the successes of the mdgs and address gaps in achievement of mdgs and while expanding the agenda to include action on other major causes of disease burden such as non communicable diseases ncds and neglected tropical diseases ntds adopt a life course approach to health promotion disease prevention and health care with particular attention to prevention and control of communicable diseases including but not limited to hiv aids tb and malaria ncds ntds mental illness injuries and disabilities promotion of child and adolescent health sexual and reproductive health and rights including ensuring safe pregnancy elderly care and emergency health services all countries make progress to allocating at least of national gdp as public financing for health with low and middle income countries reducing by at least half the gap between of gdp and current public funding reduce private out of pocket spending oops on health care and ensure voluntary health insurance and out of pocket funding is less than of all health expenditure high income countries allocate at least of gni as international assistance for health for supporting the efforts of low and middle income countries for implementing uhc as part of meeting commitments for of gdp in assistance and an additional billion in per year in official climate finance by all countries provide high quality health care based on comprehensive primary health services which include public health services as well as acute chronic and emergency clinical services in both community based and facility based settings to rural and urban populations without financial geographic gender or other social barriers to access create and support a skilled adequately resourced workforce to deliver the health services envisaged under uhc with emphasis on expanding the size skills and role of a cadre of socially empowered community health workers who are enabled to use appropriate technologies ensure access to essential medicines vaccines commodities and technologies using pooled procurement and distribution of quality assured drugs utilizing low cost generics and price controls to make drugs affordable to the health system as well individual patients effectively implement comprehensive tobacco control programs including all obligations contained within the framework convention on tobacco control fctc to substantially reduce the one billion person death toll from tobacco related diseases who projects for the st century reaching a tobacco free world by and use analogous demand and supply reduction measures to decrease the harmful use of alcohol align agriculture and food systems to assure that every person has access to a composite diet that is both calorically adequate and nutritionally appropriate at each stage of life ensure availability of clean water for drinking and personal hygiene improved public and domestic sanitation and reduction in exposure to air indoor outdoor water light and sound pollution increase use of modern fuels and technologies for domestic purposes and reduction in exposure to air pollution specifically there should be targets to substantially reduce exposure to ambient outdoor and household air pollution adopt pro health policies in other sectors such as trade and investment urban design and transport while promoting policies and actions that mitigate climate change and develop adaptive strategies to make populations more resilient to the effects of climate change on health engage and empower communities to play an active role in the design delivery and monitoring of health policies and programs including the eradication of extreme poverty social health is central to sustainable development why is health central by prioritizing sustainable development societies commit to progress across four dimensions economic development inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance each of these dimensions contributes to the others and progress across all four is required for individual and societal wellbeing health is inherently important as a human right but is also critical to achieving these four pillars national aspirations for economic growth cannot be achieved without a healthy and productive population while health benefits from economic growth its value as a critical catalyst for development led to health related goals being centrally positioned in the mdgs child and maternal mortality became a measure of a nations overall development along with poverty eradication the empowerment of women and environmental sustainability at the same time it was acknowledged that combating the spread of hiv aids and reducing the burden of tb and malaria was critical to human progress as these diseases disproportionately impact the development potential of dozens of countries further evidence of the importance of health to sustainable development are the growing number of reports such as the who commission on macroeconomics and health emphasizing the need for greater investments in health through increased public financing these reports have highlighted the multiplier effects of investment in health and the cost of neglect from preventable death and disability emphasizing the need to address not just diseases but the wider dimensions and determinants of health as the world prepares to formulate and adopt sustainable development goals sdgs the health goal proposed by the sdsn achieve health and wellbeing at all ages must be recognized as pivotal to global development even as economic development is pursued with vigor by a world that wishes to reverse the economic downturn of the past five years it must be clearly recognized that economic and social progress can neither be secure nor sustainable if sufficient investments are not made to protect and promote the health status of all people across the world current status of global health and challenges considerable progress has been made in the achievement of mdg targets profound reductions have been made in under five deaths worldwide from more than million in to around million in and maternal deaths worldwide have dropped by over this period around million people living with hiv aids now have access to anti retroviral treatments art and more than billion treatments for neglected tropical diseases have been disbursed since the spread of tuberculosis is on target to be reversed by and the global incidence of malaria has fallen by since the global target of halving the proportion of people without access to safe clean water has been met despite these achievements much remains to be done national and regional disparities remain the most formidable challenge several countries did not meet the targets while others have reached their targets but require further reductions many countries making progress have done so only in certain populations inequalities across socioeconomic gradients ethnicity gender and geographically marginalized subgroups in addition to the mandate set by the mdgs epidemiological increasing and demographic transitions have driven an increasing burden of non communicable diseases ncds particularly in low and middle income countries with increasing exposure to risk factors like tobacco and alcohol use and physical inactivity and rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases diabetes cancer respiratory diseases and mental health conditions this implies a need for reassessing health priorities in all countries low middle and high income for the post development mandate both to accelerate mdg achievement and to include emerging health concerns figure snapshot of the global burden of disease in source institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme gbd compare seattle wa ihme university of washington available and interactive at http viz healthmetricsandevaluation org gbd compare accessed october figure shows the global burden of disease in the area of the box represents the percent of the global disease burden it is clear that many of the mdg priorities for example hiv tb and malaria will remain major concerns in the post period however the post period must also address additional health concerns such as stroke heart disease represented as ihd and diabetes which represent a large share of the global burden of disease in order to accomplish the goal of achieving health and wellbeing at all ages a framework that addresses a greater diversity of issues than those prioritized by the mdgs is needed the major barriers to achieving health for all relate to health systems challenges and the socioeconomic inequities and environmental exposures that predispose precipitate and perpetuate vulnerability of individuals and populations to health risks the thematic group on health for all strongly advocates global national and regional actions for addressing these barriers proposal for a health sdg the mdgs were successful as a rallying point clearly focusing on national policy efforts towards development as simple quantitative and measurable targets they became important tools for assessing the progress made by nations in improving health policy however in their approach and implementation the exclusive focus on disease specific goals and the failure to integrate issues of inequity led to inter and intra national differences in progress towards achieving the goals in the absence of a vision for strengthening systems horizontal programs the mdgs encouraged disease specific programs vertical programs exacerbating the differences between nations in health status and disease burden at the same time the emergence of new health challenges demonstrates the need for reassessing the scope and relevance of the mdgs over time and to hics the new sdgs must follow an inclusive framework encapsulating equity and a systems approach in achieving new health targets for the sdgs must be set using a broad framework that is universal i e relevant to both lmics and hics context specific and adaptive a number of consultations and high level panel meetings have deliberated on potential candidates for a health sdg appendix after reviewing consultations and reports the sdg proposed by the tg is achieve health and wellbeing at all ages this implies that all countries achieve universal health coverage at every stage of life with particular emphasis on primary health services including mental and reproductive health to ensure that all people receive quality health services without suffering financial hardship countries also implement policies to create enabling social and environmental conditions that promote the health of populations and help individuals make healthy and sustainable decisions related to their daily living in its deliberations the tg identified interrelated targets and several indicators while this list is not exhaustive these targets and indicators provide a useful starting point for measuring the progress towards achieving this sdg the three targets are listed below while their associated indicators are available in appendix v ensure universal coverage of quality healthcare including the prevention and treatment of communicable and non communicable diseases sexual and reproductive health family planning routine immunization and mental health according the highest priority to primary health care v end preventable deaths by reducing child mortality to or fewer deaths per births maternal mortality to or fewer deaths per live births and mortality under years of age from non communicable diseases by at least percent compared with v implement policies to promote and monitor healthy diets physical activity and subjective wellbeing reduce unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use by and harmful use of alcohol by we recommend that countries adopt suitably updated mdg indicators for hiv aids tb and malaria as well as for neglected tropical diseases ntds countries that have achieved the mortality targets should set more ambitious aggregate targets that are commensurate with their development and ensure that the minimum quantitative targets are achieved for every sub population universal health coverage as a priority for post as debates concerning the post development agenda intensify more and more governments development agencies and civil society organizations are calling for prioritization of universal health coverage uhc as either a health goal or the means to achieving health goals this can be attributed to a growing recognition that increasing health coverage delivers substantial developmental benefits both in terms of better health indicators and improved economic performance including reduction of poverty levels furthermore political leaders are realizing that moving towards uhc is popular with populations across the world by improving the health and economic welfare of all people governments can foster social harmony enhance the legitimacy of the state and secure considerable political benefits this is discussed briefly in in the next section healthy life expectancy there is growing support for healthy life expectancy as a superior metric than simple life expectancy for tracking health outcomes and overall function of the health system life expectancy does not take into account periods of ill health that do not result in death however many people can lose months or years to malaria tb cancer and other conditions improvements in overall life expectancy are meaningless unless the additional years are healthy ones healthy life expectancy seeks to address this by qualifying overall life expectancy with disability adjusted life years dalys and data on morbidity to determine how many years people live at their full potential for good health as a metric healthy life expectancy is sensitive to multiple factors not just mortality it takes into account changes in the prevalence of diseases over time quality of treatment cure rates and other factors this makes it a more robust measure of the overall health of a population one challenge with healthy life expectancy is that there is a great range between countries in terms of data availability however this metric crucial in assessing the state of global health and therefore for the period the increased collection of quality data is crucial in the past three years several consultations appendix have deliberated on the opportunities and challenges provided by the existing mdgs and the call for a new health goal which resonates with contemporary issues and concerns these issues have ranged from universalism versus targeting inclusion equity concerns regarding financial protection and differences in interpretation among others this paper argues for a broad interpretation of uhc that includes promotive preventive curative palliative and rehabilitative services as well as addressing public health services such as infectious disease monitoring and ensuring food safety we also advocate addressing the social economic and environmental determinants of health discussion on the core components of uhc is provided in chapter but below is a discussion of the several opportunities and challenges presented by the framework of uhc when compared other pre existing or potential frameworks table uhc provides several opportunities and challenges challenges diverse definitions and models diverse definitions and conceptual models offer implementation of varying designs delivery thereby in agreeing on a common goal or target for comparative assessment of progress measured by diverse metrics adoption of specific metrics for measuring national and global progress towards uhc is a challenge for introducing difficulties potential for narrow interpretation uhc may be understood narrowly as just the provision of health care and many exclude action on additional determinants of health that have a profound influence on populations and individuals such a restricted interpretation would overemphasize the biomedical model of clinical care without substantial impact on population health outcomes recognition of priority equity needs a universal program may dilute the priority accorded to the needs of the poor and may permit in a disproportionate manner though better access and negotiating power the non poor to benefit opportunities inclusion uhc addresses a wide range of health problems across all age groups and through the life course equity if designed well ensuring universal access to quality services uhc has the potential for reducing health disparities financial protection uhc reduces out of pocket spending oops decreasing the risk of poverty spending by individuals from health care livelihood generation uhc emphasizes a multi layered health workforce that delivers primary healthcare services the employment of both physician and non physician health care providers is encouraged with particular emphasis on young women entering labor markets common global vision uhc is applicable to both hics and lmics and can be implemented based on contextual priorities unifying global rallying point uhc has been strongly endorsed by the who un world bank civil society organizations many governments sector confederations through reports declarations resolutions and statements issued in the past three years private and underlying principles of uhc the life course approach the tg proposes an inclusive health sdg that does not look at disease categories but instead looks at maximizing health and wellbeing through the life course this goal is recommended based on criticisms of approaches that segment health and wellbeing into stages such as healthy infancy healthy childhood and healthy pregnancy a life course approach acknowledges that individuals may be affected by infectious diseases hiv aids tb as well as chronic diseases diabetes cancer and provides a continuum of care across the lifetime of an individual it also recognizes that illness at a particular age may be preconditioned by factors operating at an earlier age e g childhood under nutrition can predispose individuals to adult cardiovascular disease and diabetes primary health care a priority the mandate for a broader uhc acknowledges the multiple dimensions of health and wellbeing the focus of this broader mandate continues to be primary health care achieved through horizontal programs that focus on strengthening health systems and providing public health services such as disease surveillance this approach recognizes the need to address challenges of human resources drugs and essential medicines and nutritional policies among others action on determinants through multisectoral initiatives the tg recognizes that the agenda for the unfinished burden of disease and emerging health conditions cannot be addressed without the concerted engagement of a diversity of stakeholders including government civil society academia the media and private industry further health needs to become a priority for actors outside the health sector and sectors must work together to accomplish health objectives an analysis of some intersectoral linkages is provided in chapter an independent review of the first ten years of thailands universal coverage scheme ucs shows a dramatic reduction in the proportion of out of pocket spending oops decline in health expenditure and falls in impoverishment due health care costs between and the incidence of catastrophic health care expenditure amongst the poorest quintile of ucs members fell from to furthermore the incidence of non poor households falling below the poverty line because of health care costs fell from in to in the review calculated that the comprehensive benefit package provided by the ucs and the reduced level of out of pocket expenditure protected a cumulative total of households from health related impoverishment between and this is equivalent to the area between the two lines figure number of households protected from health impoverishment in thailand equity through models for financial protection the adopted sdg must recognize critical concerns regarding equity in particular ensuring that poor and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are protected financially from impoverishing expenditures the tg proposes that the broader vision for uhc must disproportionately benefit poor and deprived populations protecting them from high healthcare costs and from a diversity of conditions making the case for uhc externalities and synergies several arguments highlight the large positive externalities and impact of uhc on health outcomes in addition to human rights and equity as the basis for uhc appendix arguments in its favor also highlight its political and economic benefits below we summarize some of these arguments uhc improves health outcomes there is broad consensus that the ultimate goal of the health sector is to improve health outcomes increasing healthy life expectancy reducing maternal and child mortality rates and reducing the burden of disease it is vitally important that health inequalities are reduced and that improvement is for everyone not just certain groups making progress towards uhc as defined above will reduce health inequalities causal analyses from nations has shown that broader health coverage generally leads to better access to necessary care and improved population health with the largest gains accruing to poorer people impressive health outcome results have been demonstrated in low income countries in sub saharan africa in a countdown to case study on niger published in the lancet amouzou et al celebrated the impact of nigers uhc approach in reducing child mortality from deaths per live births in to in an annual average reduction of they attributed this success to government policies supporting universal access provision of free health care for pregnant women and children and decentralized nutrition programs this provides evidence that increasing the coverage of effective services combined with the removal of health service user fees that increased financial protection and improved access is vital for success in achieving health mdgs and sdgs uhc delivers economic and political benefits the world health report in demonstrated the catastrophic effects of healthcare costs with nearly million people worldwide suffering financial hardship and million being pushed below the poverty line as a result of oops in the affluent indian state of gujarat of households falling below the poverty line did so as a consequence of health care costs in the united states over of personal bankruptcies have been attributed to medical expenses as the who points out the out of pocket costs incurred by poor households as a result of lack of sexual and reproductive health care are staggering for example the complications from unsafe abortion cost individuals and households in sub saharan africa million out of pocket each year who avoiding financial losses associated with unaffordable and sometimes sudden health care expenditure can help households stabilize their disposable income and spend more on other goods and services improving the welfare and future prospects of the family at a macroeconomic level greater ability to consume and invest stimulates growth worries about health care bills are the main cause of excessively high savings rates in some countries such as china with negative impacts on economic growth recent experience in mexico highlights the tangible benefits of uhc reforms for households if financed and implemented well uhc reforms can be popular with the public reaping political benefits political leaders associated with such reforms have seen their personal popularity increase as a result many major uhc processes have been initiated by political leaders in the run up to elections and immediately following a transition of power political leaders in the process have derived substantial benefits from successful reforms helping them retain power in subsequent elections such as in the united states several political pioneers of uhc have become national heroes in the canadian public voted in a national poll for the greatest canadian and chose the architect of their uhc reforms tommy douglas for all these reasons the director general of the world health organization who dr margaret chan has called uhc the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer mexico recorded higher levels of financial protection from health care costs following nationwide uhc reforms in approximately million people in mexico did not have adequate financial risk protection and had to pay for the majority of their health services through out of pocket payments recognizing that this had a damaging impact on the health and economic wellbeing of households the government of mexico introduced a national protection program called the seguro popular this program was mostly financed through taxation with only richer households being asked to make modest annual contributions within a decade million people enrolled in seguro popular the majority coming from the poorest income deciles a year review of these reforms shows an increase in the utilization of essential services by households improved health outcomes and increased financial protection from to effective coverage of a number of key maternal and child health interventions e g antenatal care immunizations and treatment of diarrhea increased significantly with seguro popular members achieving higher coverage rates than uninsured people this increased service coverage contributed to a sustained fall in child and maternal mortality rates and a reduction in health outcome inequality looking at the economic benefits of increased financial protection survey data showed falls in impoverishing health expenditure with greater reductions amongst seguro popular members from to the incidence of catastrophic expenditure fell from of the population to and impoverishing health expenditure from to services they need without suffering financial hardship universal health coverage is when all people receive the quality health universal health coverage as a priority for the post agenda concept components and collaborations concepts what do we mean by universal health coverage as uhc emerges as the common rallying point for health policy and advocacy it is important to define its conceptual framework several definitions of universal health coverage exist with varying levels of complexity reflecting the contextual interpretations in high middle and low income nations a simple definition incorporating the key concepts is underlying this definition of uhc is a complex framework that represents the interactions between health systems and populations for this report we have defined uhc comprehensively as referring to equitable access to affordable accountable appropriate health services of assured quality to all people including promotive preventive curative palliative and rehabilitative services in defining uhc it is crucial to recognize that uhc must be supported by policies and services addressing the wider determinants social environmental and economic of health delivered to individuals and populations the role of governments and public systems as guarantors and enablers is key even as efforts are made to mobilize all relevant societal resources for the delivery of services governments must also ensure the engagement of all stakeholders with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups to safeguard access to quality care for all persons and maintain accountability this definition is consistent with earlier definitions provided by the who in and by the sdsn in recognizing that a narrow definition of uhc may exclude action on social and environmental determinants the high level expert group on universal health coverage in india expanded the definition to include a package of essential health services as well as a broader set of policies relevant to public health the goal as proposed by us includes both components any definition of uhc while including key principles must also link to appropriate metrics for measurement of progress towards the goal metrics may be selected to include assured access e g percent of children covered by immunization percent of women having access to sexual and reproductive health services and rights percent of population provided with essential drugs as prescribed by a doctor and financial protection e g proportion of oops to total health expenditure proportion of the population experiencing impoverishing health expenditures even as a set of essential services is provided to all programs targeting the poor for assured coverage of those services or the delivery of additional services can still be accommodated within a uhc framework further an equity measure can be added to each metric of uhc e g gaps in access and financial protection between the highest and lowest income quintiles different gender groups age groups etc are narrowing as the uhc programs are progressively implemented at each stage of the evolution of uhc in a country the health needs of the poor and marginalized must be prioritized components what does universal health coverage include any definition of uhc must include two core components a universalism everybody should have access to needed promotive preventive curative palliative and rehabilitative health services furthermore these services must be of sufficient quality to have an appropriate impact on the health of the people who are using them it is no use having access to health workers if they are not trained to make a correct diagnosis or if they prescribe inappropriate or ineffective medicines b equity when accessing services people should not face high out of pocket expenditures that might lead to financial hardship or deter people from using services it is imperative that three dimensions of equity be incorporated equity in opportunity the ability of individuals and populations to maximize their potential for better health equity in access in the design and delivery of health and other allied systems such as food built environment and urban systems and equity in outcomes for the measurement of which evidence needs strengthening in the world health report depicted uhc as figure illustrating the policy choices faced by governments and exemplifying the two core principles of universalism and equity the diagram asks three critical questions a populations who is covered b services what services are covered c finances what do people have to pay out of pocket figure the universal health coverage cube while the diagram does not show social environmental or other determinants of health it is important that the health sector work with other sectors for example water sanitation agriculture and food systems urban planning etc to address determinants as part of a comprehensive health system this group interprets services as including services at the level of both individuals ex vaccination or the treatment of malaria as well as polulations ex infectious diesase monitoring the uhc approach is useful as it recognizes that progress needs to be made along multiple dimensions progress along only one dimension may not be enough to improve outcomes for instance promising free health services is an ineffective strategy if there is inequity in access or if services are of poor quality similarly uhc is effective in adjusting the relative burden of public and private financing on the health system both in terms of service and population coverage which is useful for financing institutions finally uhc is also effective in the push towards increasing population coverage and expanding the beneficiary base similarly the uhc approach makes the political system realize it cannot focus on curative services alone and must ensure effective prevention policies such as policies to curb tobacco use or infrastructure to ensure safe water and sanitation societal and community interhousehold and intergroup race religion ethnicity caste tribe including development partners the poor migrants displaced persons civil conflict natural disasters climatologic events etc collaborations who does uhc involve the responsibility for achieving uhc ultimately rests with governments who must lead the development and implementation of uhc however to ensure success all stakeholders must be involved in setting the strategy local and national governments civil society organizations the private sector and most importantly the general population further keeping in mind the country context is essential this strategy should incorporate priority actions and investments along each axis along with recognizing the necessary trade offs for instance if greater financing resources become available to nations particularly low and middle income countries lmics more should be invested by purchasing medical equipment or eliminating co payments for some services figure key stakeholder groups at multiple levels the agenda for uhc must be inclusive and must recognize the disproportionate burden of disease and sickness faced by specific disadvantaged groups uhc must consider determinants that predispose precipitate or perpetuate individuals and populations to risks and reduce their resilience a depiction of disadvantage within households between households between social groups and at the societal level is presented in figure this representation reaffirms that while uhc stresses health for all there is a need to strengthen equity mechanisms to make the delivery of uhc more effective women men lgbt children adolescents older populations disability interpersonal and intrahousehold delivering universal health coverage there are four core requirements for implementing uhc financing human resources equipment and infrastructure capitalizing on synergies between sectors and involving all stakeholders and good governance all of these involve complex issues of policy governance equity and participation some of these are discussed below financing globally nations at all income levels have recognized that health financing reforms are essential to achieve uhc in the strategies for undertaking such reforms the who has advised that governments must consider three main functions of the health financing system these are raising sufficient financial resources to cover the costs of the health system pooling resources to protect people from the financial consequences of ill health purchasing health services to ensure the optimum use of available resources raising and pooling sufficient financial resources for uhc the level of financial resources required for uhc in any particular country is a function of the uhc cube i e the population covered and the range quantity and quality of services covered a key to uhc implementation is raising domestic funding to ensure access to quality services and financial protection to the entire population in the past low income countries were advised to provide an essential package of services frequently focusing on mdg priorities maternal and child health hiv aids tb and malaria today there is increasing recognition that all countries must strive towards good quality comprehensive primary healthcare phc services for all this comprehensive approach must incorporate greater equity as evidence shows poor and disadvantaged groups have a greater service need and therefore reap greater benefits while the majority of the current disease burden can be addressed in lmics through primary care interventions preventive curative and rehabilitative over time resources need to be increased and services expanded beyond phc increased resources are also needed by governments to meet emerging challenges such as ageing epidemiological changes and greater availability of new technologies an increasing global consensus on the better performance of public or mandatory pre payment financing mechanisms has been emerging in terms of both efficiency and equity this has been attributed to the compulsory nature of general taxation and other government revenue sources e g royalties on the exploitation of natural resources and social health insurance contributions governments have been successful in raising substantial levels of revenue with relatively low administration costs when these resources have been pooled mandatory pre payment mechanisms ensure equity as healthy and wealthy populations are compelled to subsidize the sicker poor in contrast point of service fees which the president of the world bank recently called unjust and unnecessary raise little revenue are associated with high administration costs and are fundamentally inequitable because of their reliance on ability to pay private voluntary health insurance including community based insurance schemes tend to have low coverage rates high administration costs and often exclude the poor several low and middle income countries have dramatically increased government revenue through improved collection efficiency and promoting greater tax compliance e g south africa kenya similarly domestic government revenue in lmics could be dramatically enhanced through improved global governance on tax competition and tax havens increasing transparency especially on payments related to natural resource extraction and ensuring fair trade policies of equal importance to generating sufficient government revenue for the health sector is integrating funding from different public sources in large risk pools to avoid the inefficiencies and inequities associated with fragmented pools which often translate into tiered health systems in brazil initiated an extensive program of health reforms with the intention of increasing the coverage of effective services for poor and vulnerable people especially those who had experienced poor quality care and high user fees following significant increases in public financing the government was able to provide universal free health services to the entire population focusing on the poorest and as a result health indicators improved markedly the family health program later strategy led to the introduction and scale up of primary care teams consisting of a doctor nurse and community health workers that now cover over million people from to infant mortality in brazil fell from per live births to and life expectancy for both sexes increased by years over the same period moreover these uhc reforms reduced health inequalities with the life expectancy gap between the wealthier south and poorer north falling from years to years there is a growing trend amongst lmics to develop homegrown systems appropriate for their own contexts of particular note have been the successes of health systems in latin america e g brazil mexico and costa rica and asia thailand taiwan and sri lanka to use increased public financing to scale up coverage these models are subtly different but all have one common feature in recognizing that it is very difficult to collect insurance contributions from those employed in the informal sector they rely heavily on tax financing to fill gaps including innovative tax structures like tobacco taxes that encourage behavioral change while raising funds funding the provision of comprehensive phc services for everyone will not be feasible for the lowest income countries unless there is continued external funding support through a mechanism that allocates external funding according to each countrys shortfall in domestic funding as these countries work to raise domestic funds which is partly dependent on global action e g to reduce avoidance of payment of taxes in lmics by multinational corporations and close the shortfall gap over time while mobilizing sufficient resources is essential for uhc prudent and strategic purchasing of services is critical for ensuring efficient use of resources in order to maximize benefits and promote sustainability in recent years performance based provider payment methods which links payment to individual providers or institutions to predefined activities or service quality that have proven to be cost effective in producing health outcome have gained currency as a way for incentivizing providers to provide high quality of care there are a number of successful examples for example in rwanda the republic of congo burundi etc refs provider payment methods also need to be accompanied by quality review and audit development and implementation of treatment guidelines clinical protocol and other quality improvement programs in areas where the population density can support more than one provider competitive bidding and contracting can also be considered to improve providers and suppliers responsiveness to the standards and needs of the purchasers human resources equipment and infrastructure the global push to uhc cannot be successful without a multi layered skilled adequately compensated health workforce contributing to preventive curative and rehabilitative services many challenges face human resources for health hrh including complex discourses on human rights and development both of those consuming services and those engaged in service delivery as well as around the economics of health and healthcare unresolved debates have led to a global shortage of hrh b between country and within country disparities in the distribution of the workforce and c inadequacies in skills and training of the existing workforce this equation has been further complicated by the growing burden of ncds that require not just vertical program delivery but the provision of both acute and chronic care as plans for the post development agenda take shape these unresolved questions need greater research and program implementation focus while simultaneously dealing with the most urgent needs of health the agenda of uhc emphasizes the need for equitable coverage and access to health services a major obstacle to equity is the shortage of workers which is particularly acute in rural areas areas without access to transport or communication low income neighborhoods and areas without other supportive infrastructure such as schools in several lmics governments have been engaged in discussions on incentives to lure doctors and skilled medical staff to these areas inequities in the distribution of healthcare are further exacerbated by hrh flight or the relocation of trained medical staff from lmics to hics the shortage of nurses and support staff in several lmics is particularly serious this places increasing pressure on existing staff with impacts on efficiency and quality of services to reap the benefits of uhc well trained and well resourced health workers particularly those at the frontline need to be at the core of the global health agenda there are roles for highly skilled doctors frontline workers and village level health and nutrition workers village level health workers in lmics play a crucial role in reducing mortality from communicable diseases a large share of which is attributable to the undernourishment of the child simple but important skills such as training village level health workers in weighing the child according to growth charts can play a vital role in the global war on under nutrition similarly frontline workers can play a major role in prevention by measuring and systematically recording risk factors for ncds in order to initiate risk reduction measures through counseling and guideline based therapies the role of simple technology in ensuring a systematic approach can be vital burundi has recorded a spectacular decline in infant and child mortality which each fell in only five years from to the decline began when the government provided free universal health care for pregnant women and children under age five in addition to removing financial barriers therefore increasing demand and financial protection the government of burundi also substantially raised public financing and introduced new performance based financing systems this helped channel public funds including aid to front line services including ndt treatment and control more efficiently and enabled the government to meet the huge increase in demand for services the higher utilization of maternal and child health services has been one of the major factors contributing to burundis improved health indicators while the right to health of those consuming health services is important the rights of those delivering services are equally critical nations cannot resolve issues around inequality in health care delivery without addressing the structural issues pertaining to socioeconomic conditions a disproportionate amount of research currently focuses on the push factors i e how to get the hrh to work in less served areas a greater emphasis is needed on both research and policy action around the pull factors i e how to attract a quality work force to work to rural or less served areas even if it is for stipulated periods of time e g or years this complex agenda involving some of the social determinants around rural to urban migration rural prosperity and urban development holds the key to finding sustainable solutions to health disparities equally critical to achieving health objectives is ensuring that the health workforce has the equipment infrastructure and supplies needed to provide essential service a skilled obstetric surgeon cannot provide a safe caesarean section without the proper anesthesia surgical tools and hygienic room a skilled community health worker needs rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and medication priorities for action in this area include solving supply chain issues with critical drugs and ensuring their affordability making sure service points have essential equipment as well as electricity to run that equipment and ensuring emergency transportation to higher level service points when necessary i e a midwife delivering in a household calling for transport to a hospital additionally it is essential that care centers be supplied with safe water and sanitation facilities one million community health workers project community health workers have been recognized for their success in reducing morbidity and averting mortality in mothers newborns and children while they are most effective when supported by a clinically skilled health workforce they have proven crucial in settings where the overall primary health care system is weak community health worker programs exist in several countries ethiopia kenya malawi nigeria rwanda senegal and tanzania but there is a critical need to scale them up and integrate them into national health systems to succeed it is essential that this work force is trained in delivering care according to standardized protocols and provided technology through mobile devices for monitoring services the initiative estimates that training and financing health workers to serve an average of rural inhabitants will cost per patient per year adding to an estimated billion this is estimated to fall under projected governmental health budgetary constraints and within the boundaries of donor assistance being pledged and anticipated the program works through emphasis on four aspects a point of care diagnosis b scalable supervision c standardized care and d rapid training synergies and stakeholders health linkages with other major sectors such as agriculture education energy transport housing and policies that address climate change gender womens empowerment and urban development provide an important framework for engagement it is essential that the post development agenda and resulting policies recognize these linkages when designing policies to achieve future development goals impact across multiple sectors should be taken into account to increase synergistic effects and reduce detrimental results in particular health should be considered when designing policies in all of the allied sectors and health outcomes included in the monitoring and evaluation of such policies some of these interlinkages have been developed and are discussed in the next chapter several examples from policy show the benefits of intersectoral policies controlling indoor air pollution through improved cook stoves or fuel switching can benefit human health while reducing fuel costs and carbon emissions policies on indoor air pollution with a narrow focus on health may increase greenhouse gas emissions for example if they depend on electricity generated by coal combustion the key is in identifying possible co benefits to be achieved in the policy design stage when designing public transportation systems urban air pollution can be reduced traffic flow ameliorated and road safety improved planning walkable and bikeable cities has the added benefit of increasing exercise and reducing greenhouse gas emissions however to reap all these benefits urban planners must work with health officials to design coherent plans it is important to identify the potential positive and negative impact of policies while designing them to ensure that these can be monitored for instance agricultural policies seeking to improve incomes by raising the yields of cash crops may reduce food security a more thoughtful approach to agriculture policy would examine yields linking them to socioeconomic prosperity improved food security and nutrition carefully designed policies supported by economic analyses have the potential to capitalize on linkages between sectors maximizing positive results supporting all four pillars of sustainable development economic social environmental and governance it is therefore critical that health be prioritized when crafting policies on agriculture education womens empowerment and other future priorities a critical component to successfully achieving multiple policy goals is the involvement of all stakeholders throughout the design implementation and evaluation stages of a particular policy stakeholder participation ensures effective priority setting as community representatives are best suited to identify key solutions the involvement of the expert community in the form of both academia and the private sector encourages innovation in policymaking and the implementation of solutions provided conflicts of identified and excluded non profits community based organizations and aid organizations have proven to be critical in providing both knowledge and financing in interventions there is a significant call for greater participation of all stakeholders in the post agenda the report from the secretary general called for participatory data collection crowd sourcing as one example as well as greater involvement of stakeholders in monitoring and evaluation the interim report of the open working group also calls for greater participation of all parts of society in setting and achieving the post development agenda further the sdsn report highlights involvement of stakeholders to be a key component of improving governance through increasing accountability and transparency uhc stands to benefit greatly from involvement of stakeholders from different health fields and other sectors many successful partnerships emerged to support the achievement of the mdgs including the gavi alliance for vaccines and the reproductive health supplies coalition including representatives from a diversity of sectors and backgrounds is a major key to the success of these programs successful implementation of uhc will require similarly high levels of involvement from all groups as will the inclusion of health in all policies to ensure the reaping of co benefits interest are good governance and uhc however well designed uhc will not achieve its objectives unless the governance of the health system can assure commitment integrity transparency and accountability at all levels far too often inefficiencies in the supply chain of medicines and vaccines or corruption in the process of procurement lead to program failure corruption or lack of transparency in the recruitment or transfer of health workers affects morale retention and performance effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms are essential to ensure quality and price control in the public and private sectors this becomes even more critical when public private partnerships are proposed community participation in learning and action has been shown to yield good results in improving maternal and newborn health in low resource settings healthmap engaging the virtual world for the detection and reporting of outbreaks the use of technology and online systems for mapping emerging infectious diseases is increasingly acknowledged as a useful and participatory tool for monitoring and surveillance while still in its early stages the potential for reporting infectious diseases in diverse parts of the world is significant as a tool it delivers real time information on a broad range of emerging infectious diseases for a number of consumers including governments local health departments and international travelers healthmap and other similar applications are user friendly in an increasingly connected world these systems use local contributions of information to simulate data that can be used for infection control and can be an aid to local surveillance systems the latter of which may be inadequately resourced to deal with the challenges of emerging infections one challenge is the sensitivity and specificity of information when supplied by the general population instead of medical practitioners however these systems provide a bottom up approach to information and can be a useful supplement to existing surveillance systems linking health to other development goals health is both a pre condition for and an outcome of sustainable development and relates to all four pillars of sustainable development economic social environmental and governance it is universally recognized that several critical determinants of health and illness lie outside the health sector education finance agriculture food processing trade and investment environment urban design transport communications law and human rights are some of the many areas where actions can enable or erode health health impacts several core dimensions of development a sick child cannot go to school and malnourished students perform poorly in academics as well as sports a sick employee either stays away from work absenteeism or underperforms after turning up presenteeism affecting overall economic performance at the level of household economics poor health impoverishes families through costs for care lost wages and even permanent loss of employment long periods of illness lead to stress and domestic strife within households for all of these reasons every sdg should consider pro health strategies achieving health and wellbeing at all ages is impossible without intersectoral action and enabling policies that link diverse sdsn priorities some key areas of intersection are described below health and its relationship with the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger poverty at multiple levels continues to be the most formidable challenge to improvements in health the world food program estimates that million people go to bed hungry each day and of under mortality is caused by poor nutrition micronutrient deficiency is further responsible for much morbidity in children and adults the sdgs must therefore prioritize the eradication of hunger a key component of improving global health repeated infections such as diarrhea in childhood leave behind a legacy of serious lifelong health problems such as stunted growth and impaired cognitive development with further implications on work opportunities and overall productivity in hics and lmics the increasing cost of healthcare and rising out of pocket spending oops burdens households in many regions healthcare costs are a major reason for households falling below the poverty line poor nations are unable to afford publically financed healthcare services for their populations and often rely on donor support especially to reach vulnerable populations in the absence of adequate resources lmics have had to adopt targeted instead of universalistic approaches that often miss those in greatest need by prioritizing uhc in the post development agenda and with adequate resources we can transform households impoverished by healthcare costs into resilient households that are active in the community over time as poverty is reduced and incomes rise countries will need to rely less and less on donor support and will eventually be able to finance uhc health and achieving development within planetary boundaries the sdsns report an action agenda for sustainable development states that all countries have a right to development that respects planetary boundaries ensures sustainable production and consumption patterns and helps to stabilize the global population by mid century uhc plays a key role in accomplishing this goal uhc can help to ensure universal sexual and reproductive health and rights are upheld empowering all women and men including adolescents and youth to make educated decisions about their own sexual and reproductive lives and healthcare including family planning many policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote development within planetary boundaries can also benefit health through for example reduced exposure to air pollution increased physical activity and dietary change see the section below in climate change for more information health and its relationship with ensuring effective learning for all children and youth education and health are profoundly linked both are human rights and are inputs into human capital better education contributes to better health through increased employment generating income increasing the ability of households to afford better nutrition and healthcare there is abundant evidence from across the world that education positively impacts the health status of individuals within countries even independent of income education especially womens education is another key investment with a direct impact on family planning child health and development and family nutrition this is because education increases awareness of risk factors health seeking and health utilization behaviors in turn better health has significant impact on education as discussed healthy well nourished children do better in school stunting from under nutrition in early childhood has been shown to have an impact on iq and cognitive development affecting learning and long term career prospects vaccines have the power to transform lives giving children a chance to grow up healthy go to school and improve their life prospects the relationships between education and health are vital and cannot be ignored in the post agenda it is crucial that synergies between education and health be realized such as described in the sdsn report an action agenda for sustainable development universal education for all children must be advanced vigorously and health literacy could be fast tracked through mass media and settings based non formal health education a variety of communication channels and social networks can be used for this purpose increasing the health literacy of young persons is an especially high priority to empower the global citizens of the st century with the knowledge motivation and skills needed to help them to protect personal health and act as societal change agents for promoting population health youth friendly health education is especially important in preventing unwanted pregnancy and the spread of hiv aids teaching values of human rights and gender equity and encouraging healthy habits such as healthy diets physical activity and the prevention of alcohol tobacco and drug use throughout the life course health and its relationship achieving gender equality social inclusion and human rights for all uhc will be a significant step in realizing the right to health for all uhc ensures equality in coverage and access to health services for all people however social policy at the national level cannot be successful without recognizing within household and within country inequalities based on discrimination due to gender race ethnicity age disability religion sexual orientation refugee status or other status it is therefore important that health indicators are disaggregated and achievements between groups be compared to ensure equity in improvements where there are gaps in achievement between groups countries must implement policies to ensure the closing of such gaps in some instances this will require innovative programs to address cultural barriers to consuming health services further by ensuring equity in both access to and utilization of health services by all people inequalities in other sectors such as employment will be reduced in addition the post development agenda should call on countries to address assault and violence against women and other marginalized groups including sexual violence violent crime female genital mutilation service provision for displaced and refugee communities and other determinants of health that are driven by political and or cultural factors sexual and reproductive health and rights are especially critical as women and girls bear the brunt of sexual and reproductive health problems the primary health care system as part of the delivery of srh more information on the linkages between health and education can be found in the report of the sdsn thematic group on early childhood development education and learning and transition to work entitled the future of our children lifelong multi generational learning for sustainable development www unsdsn org resources services should ensure detection and comprehensive responses to gender based violence offering a package of critical services to victims survivors gender health systems and knowledge translation early marriage and related teenage pregnancies are a result of highly unequal gender relations and discrimination against girls and women who reports that complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among girls aged years in many low and middle income countries stillbirths and newborn deaths are higher among infants born to adolescent mothers than among those born to mothers aged years health policies and programs that focus merely on institutional deliveries ignore these facts in a project in koppal karnataka india combined a nuanced gendered framework to strengthen evidence and advocacy to reduce maternal morbidity mortality and violence against women the projects verbal autopsies of maternal deaths and near misses since revealed systemic failures and the need for accountability in obstetric care and health systems that fuelled high levels of maternal mortality despite rising rates of institutional delivery health and its relationship with improving agricultural systems and raising rural prosperity the mdgs put emphasis on improving food security but did not devote much attention to improving rural infrastructure irrigation safe drinking water sanitation fuel power electricity banking transport health service provision education and information technology as a means to improve rural livelihoods and increase production sustainably the post agenda needs to consider how rural prosperity can improve the lives of millions of smallholder farmers while simultaneously improving diets and nutrition for both rural and urban dwellers in all countries this can also reduce the health impact of deforestation air and water pollution and zoonotic diseases to which agriculture contributes since women are employed in very large numbers in farming their health is directly linked to safety of agricultural methods and in turn on their ability to contribute to agricultural productivity a detailed framework for sustainable agroecological intensification sai and rural development can be found in the report of the sdsns tg on sustainable agriculture and food systems a key component of this framework is expanding health coverage to smallholder farmers especially the rural poor who currently have low access to care ensuring their health has implications for increasing farm productivity and improving food and nutrition security hitherto the objective of agriculture systems was to provide energy caloric security without taking into account the multiple nutrient needs that can only be obtained through balanced composite diets this resulted in a disproportionate emphasis on supply of cereals as the source of calories from now on agriculture systems have to become better aligned to nutrition goals so that all persons everywhere in the world will have access to diets that are calorically adequate and nutritionally appropriate health and its relationship with empowering inclusive productive and resilient cities the growth of cities and progressive urbanization of the global population presents challenges as well as opportunities more

resources for health the urban poor suffer daily deprivations of shelter and food security with millions living in slums and squatter settlements prone to water and sanitation related diseases urban dwellers rich and poor are at greater risk of harmful health behaviors like smoking alcohol and drug use diseases like tb and dengue fever and road traffic injuries relative to their rural counterparts urban populations particularly those residing in unplanned housing or densely populated areas are disproportionately affected by environmental disasters services related to the provision of clean water supply for drinking and hygiene sanitation green spaces community recreational facilities protected cycling lanes safe pedestrian paths traffic safety pollution control and public protection from crime are among the health needs that the sdsns thematic group on sustainable cities address in their report it is important that uhc also be realized in urban settings as a complement to better city planning policies the health needs of rural to urban migrants and slum communities need particular attention particularly as spatial design is developed for accessible primary health care through suitably located community health centers the sdgs are an opportunity for health friendly urbanization and to invest in gathering greater evidence on the costs and benefits of urbanization on human health health and its relationship with curbing human induced climate change and ensuring sustainable energy air pollution is a leading cause of premature death with most deaths occurring in lmics the global burden of disease study found that million deaths each year can be attributed to outdoor air pollution with most deaths occurring in cities and another million due to indoor air pollution mostly in rural areas fuel based lighting also leads to burn injuries and dangerous fires while urban and rural residents face different health problems as a result of energy use there is a common solution access to modern clean energy services and increased energy efficiency there are many innovative programs installing solar wind and natural gas in both rural and urban settings many done under the auspices of the un initiative sustainable energy for all seall modern and efficient energy services improve health outcomes as delivery rooms are well lit vaccines refrigerated and electrical equipment like ekg machines available access to modern and clean energy services provided through either traditional grid connected means or innovative models of off grid wind and solar are important for clinics to provide quality healthcare in the developed world healthcare is often energy intensive but new efficient medical appliances offer solutions to improve load management reduced energy consumption is not only eco friendly and reduces health risks from air pollution improving energy efficiency and increasing the amount of energy coming from renewable sources also helps slow climate change which is increasingly shown to affect human health vector borne diseases like malaria or west nile virus can shift range under global warming increased risk from natural disasters like droughts heat waves floods landslides intense hurricanes typhoons and other extreme weather events are linked to climate change and pose direct threats to health the effects on agriculture livelihoods mental health population displacement and conflict have direct impacts on health in a report dara estimated that climate change was already responsible for an additional deaths in inequity is an important aspect of this relationship since a disproportionate burden is borne by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations health and its relationship with securing ecosystem services and biodiversity and ensuring good management of water and other natural resources research in health is increasingly showing linkages for more information see the publications from the sdsn thematic group on sustainable cities inclusive resilient and connected at http unsdsn org thematicgroups tg between environment and health the role of ecology is evident in the rise of new infections particularly zoonotic infections resulting from the interface between humans and domestic animals in processes such as deforestation and livestock farming air and water pollution also impact health and the effects of marine pollution on seafood are a significant threat to the health of the coastal poor freshwater is essential for human life potable water is needed for daily drinking and cooking contaminated water is a cause of many infectious diseases especially childhood diarrhea that is the second leading cause of under mortality water is also needed for personal hygiene bathing hand washing and ablutions as the availability of clean water is reduced health is endangered protecting our water resources is an essential component of the sdg framework uhc implemented with an equity lens provides a safety net to buffer the effects and impact of the environment on human health health and transforming governance for sustainable development trade and investment policies related to essential drugs vaccines commodities health relevant technologies agricultural produce food products tobacco alcohol and international agreements related to services including health worker migration have important implications for health while trade and investment policies have largely remained agnostic or sometimes even antagonistic to public health concerns in the past in the post development framework they need to become more sensitive and better aligned to public health priorities in keeping with the goals of sustainable development additionally the provision of uhc depends on adequate financial resources all high income countries should provide of gross national income gni in oda with earmarked for health there are also strong linkages between poor governance civil conflict and ill health political instability and sociocultural challenges have impeded the achievement of basic health targets of immunization linked to diseases that are eradicable the cases of polio from northern nigeria afghanistan and lately parts of pakistan provide daily challenges in implementation of immunization programs and personal safety of medical staff in sensitive areas these factors have led to disparities in commitment towards health policy in implementation of programs and in the resulting health outcomes global economic slowdown recession and resulting austerity measures by governments have affected public systems of health apart from other social sectors and have further exacerbated health disparities health in all policies case of tobacco control according to the who million persons died due to tobacco related diseases in the th century who also estimates that the death toll due to tobacco will be one billion human lives in the st century sustainable development is inconceivable and unachievable if the elimination of tobacco is not an integral part of the framework for development tobacco is not only a health hazard it is a threat to the environment through deforestation wood fuel is burnt for curing wood and cigarette machines use miles of paper an hour extensive pesticide use high levels of water and soil nutrients depleted for cultivation soil erosion and strewing of butts it is a fire hazard responsible for dangerous domestic and forest fires it is unacceptable that around million hectares of arable land are wasted on a killer crop instead of growing nutrient crops across the world poor consume tobacco more frequently and consumption of tobacco products is a cause of families being pushed into poverty recognizing this multi dimensional nature of tobacco related harm to several areas of human development who developed the framework convention of tobacco control fctc countries have ratified the first ever international public health treaty since its adoption in the treaty provisions call for actions across multiple sectors raising tobacco taxes comprehensive bans on all forms of advertising sponsorship and promotion bans on smoking in public and work places strong rotating health warnings on tobacco products packs control of illicit trade support for cessation programs provision of economically viable alternate livelihoods to tobacco farmers and workers integration of tobacco control in health education development and poverty reduction programs who also developed the mpower policy package to assist countries in implementing the fctc raising tobacco taxes is an especially promising policy as they raise revenue for health services within the uhc model while reducing the burden of future health care costs on the system as the fctc is implemented by governments in both hics and lmics we can expect to see an increase in overall health a decrease in costs associated with health care as tobacco related diseases decrease and an increase of available funds at the household level for education food and or housing tobacco control also exemplifies the need for a life course approach commencing from protection of the unborn child to cessation at any age health services too must integrate tobacco control within the ambit of uhc both for prevention of primary uptake and promotion of cessation appendix targets and indicators in the sdsn report an action agenda for sustainable development goals were proposed for the period while nearly all goals have implications for health the most relevant

the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs brundtland commission universal health coverage uhc the goal of uhc is to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them for a community or country to achieve universal health coverage several factors must be in place including a strong efficient well run health system that meets priority health needs through people centered integrated care including services for hiv aids tuberculosis malaria ntds and other communicable diseases non communicable diseases sexual and reproductive health and rights and maternal and child health by detecting health conditions and risk factors early having the capacity to treat disease and helping patients with rehabilitation informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness affordability a system for financing health services so people do not suffer financial hardship when using them this can be achieved in a variety of ways access to essential medicines commodities and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems a sufficient capacity of well trained motivated

physical activity discourage unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake and track subjective wellbeing and social capital report of the united nations sustainable development solutions network june appendix evidence for universal health coverage indicators rationale for financial protection and financial resources for health indicators a key component of uhc is to ensure that everyone has protection from the risk of incurring costs associated with using health services effective financial risk protection in the health systems context particularly involves protecting individuals and families against further impoverishment from spending on health building on the globally established body of work and accumulated experience and evaluation in a wide range of countries we propose the following key indicator impoverishing expenditure the percentage of the population pushed below or further below the ppp poverty line as a result of out of pocket oop payments to use health services in the past month it is critical that global efforts to eradicate extreme poverty are not undermined by impoverishing expenditure to use needed health services given the differential geographic access to health services we propose that this indicator focuses not only on oop payments to a health care provider or for medicines but also oop payments for transport to use services both these indicators are easily computable in all countries using household budget surveys and estimates currently exist for most countries permitting easy estimation of baseline estimates when monitoring progress toward targets in terms of the targets that should be set we propose that the level of impoverishing expenditures be set at zero recognizing that the concept of uhc requires the complete elimination of all financial hardship when accessing health care although this indicator provides important insights into the extent to which a country is or is not providing adequate financial protection for its residents it is not feasible to move towards uhc through providing such financial protection in the absence of adequate levels of domestic public funding with associated decreases in voluntary payments accompanied by continued donor funding support in lower income countries it is thus critical to include specific indicators that encourage changes in financing sources that will promote uhc we propose three key indicators in this regard first all countries should make progress to domestic public funding for health care of of gdp a small number of countries have made progress to uhc goals with lower levels of funding but this is the exception and requires extremely high levels of efficiency that are very domestic public funding is defined as including all sources of mandatory pre payment funding including government revenue and possibly also mandatory health insurance at present the only target relating to government spending on health care that is widely used is the abuja target which calls for at least of total government spending to be devoted to the health sector we believe it is preferable to express the public sending target as a percentage of gdp for several reasons specifying a target in terms of increasing the health sectors share of government expenditure implies that spending on other sectors should decline which could undermine spending on other social services and hence adversely affect other social determinants of health instead there is an urgent need to increase public spending on health services as well as other social sectors given the large variability in government revenues and expenditure across countries which is not strongly correlated with level of economic development it is problematic to set a target relative to the government budget in that it does not exert pressure on governments to ensure maximum available resources as committed to in the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights which shows that public health expenditure of of gdp is generally required to limit oop payments to a maximum of of total health expenditure to promote access to needed health care proxied by achieving coverage for difficult to achieve there is a growing evidence base that a minimum public funding level of of gdp is usually required to make considerable progress to uhc recent analyses of the relationship between public spending on health as a of gdp and key indicators of health status financial protection and service coverage point to of gdp being an appropriate target mcintyre meheus this evidence can be summarized as follows to dramatically improve health status e g reduce imr to per live births generally requires government spending of above of gdp to reduce financial catastrophe and impoverishment to negligible levels requires reducing out of pocket payments to of total health expenditure world health organization which in turn requires government spending of more than of gdp see figure immunizations and deliveries by skilled birth attendants and to achieve the global average of core medical professionals per population requires government spending of of gdp or more figure relationship between government health spending and dependence on out of pocket payments source updated from mcintyre and kutzin a target of around of gdp is supported by global analyses undertaken for the world health report on financing for uhc two observations from that report are particularly pertinent those countries whose entire populations have access to a set of services usually have relatively high levels of mandatory pooled funds in the order of of gross domestic product gdp world health organization xv general government health spending as a percentage of gross domestic product indicates the capacity and will of government to shield the population from the costs of care it is difficult to get close to universal coverage at less than of gdp although for many low and middle income countries reaching this goal is aspirational in the short term and something to plan for in the longer run world health organization level and avoiding reductions finally using data from the world health statistics dataset the global average of government health care expenditure is of gdp it is recognized that public spending on health is far lower than this in other countries ranging from an average of of gdp in upper middle income countries to of gdp in low income countries thus as noted in the world health report the target of of gdp in public spending on health is an aspirational goal for low and middle income countries and we recommend that these countries at least make progress towards this goal and reduce by half the gap between of gdp and their current public funding levels public spending on health exceeds the of gdp level in almost all high income oecd countries with an overall average of public spending of of gdp for all high income countries while setting a separate higher target for high income countries may be desirable there has been no published analysis to establish what an appropriate public spending level in these countries would be high income countries should at least aspire to exceeding the of gdp public spending in current public spending unless demonstrated efficiency gains can be achieved where efficiency is distinct from cost containment and can be defined as producing the same outputs with fewer resources while not compromising quality of care second international experience clearly indicates that countries that have made considerable progress to uhc fund their health services predominantly from domestic public i e mandatory pre payment sources generally comprising or more see figure for original oecd countries and some lmics with considerable progress to uhc conversely as explicitly stated in the world health report it is not possible to achieve uhc through voluntary payments for health care on this basis we recommend an indicator that oop payments and voluntary health insurance contributions comprise a maximum of of total health care expenditure finally continued donor funding support is required for low income countries to provide phc services and basic referral services even if these countries achieved the target of domestic public spending on health of of gdp they would be spending no more than us per capita on health services with several spending less that us per capita this is well below the necessary per capita spending levels for such services which is estimated to be us in terms updated by mcintyre and meheus from the calculations of the commission on macroeconomics and health and the high level task force on innovative international financing for health systems we recommend that all high income countries devote of their gni to oda for health services several upper middle income countries are beginning to provide oda funding on a voluntary basis we recommend that there should be an explicit requirement for any country reaching high income status to provide oda for health and other social services in line with the need for shared responsibility for global human development e r u t i d n e p x e e r a c h t l a e h l a t o t f o t n e c r e p australia austria belgium canada denmark finland france germany ireland italy new zealand netherlands japan norway portugal spain united kingdom switzerland sweden costa rica thailand cuba mandatory prespayment voluntary prespayment outsofspocket figure financing sources for uhc source data derived from who national health accounts dataset it will be important to take global action to improve low and middle income countries ability to generate domestic public funds for health and other social services such as to reduce tax avoidance by high net worth individuals and transnational companies address tax competition between countries ensure that government revenue from minerals and other natural resources are maximized and addressing unfair trade practices however this will take considerable time to achieve and hence continued oda is required in the interim in line with the emphasis in this report on the importance of phc the limited financial resources available from domestic public and oda sources in low income countries should be devoted exclusively to phc services which include core referral services in middle income countries comprehensive phc services should again be the main focus for the use of public financial resources expanding to a wider range of services over time as gdp and hence public funding of health services at a level of of gdp increases within high income countries it may be necessary to assess whether phc services are being given sufficient priority given that there is frequently too heavy an emphasis on tertiary care in these countries rationale for service use indicators the second core component of uhc is that everyone within a country should be able to access needed quality health services the ultimate goal of this element of uhc is that those who need care actually use services and that these services effectively address health care needs the ideal in assessing achievement of this aspect of uhc is to evaluate if everyone who has a need for health care actually uses the appropriate service this requires that one is able to measure both the numerator use of services and denominator need for health care accurately it is easiest to do this for individual services particularly where the denominator can be accurately estimated on the basis of demographic data such as for immunization coverage of young children or antenatal visits and assisted delivery by a qualified health worker for pregnant women given the ease of measurement it is unsurprising that measures of maternal and child health services are the most frequently measured and reported indicators however there have been criticisms of this narrow focus on maternal and child health services indicators have also been put forward for measuring treatment in relation to communicable diseases particularly tb hiv and malaria more recently efforts have been made to estimate the need for and use of non communicable diseases ncds particularly hypertension and diabetes we recommend that indicators of coverage include maternal and child health communicable and non communicable disease services with an additional set of indicators for countries where data are already available while these indicators provide very valuable insights into how the health system is performing in relation to specific services they only do so for a very small sample of the hundreds of different health services provided an alternative approach is to focus on measuring total use of outpatient and inpatient services i e average number of outpatient visits per person per year and average number of admissions per people per year this would provide a more comprehensive indication of the use of the full range of health services although it is difficult to determine what level of outpatient service utilization is needed within a particular country as this is influenced by its demographic and epidemiological profile we recommend basic minimum utilization rates that all countries should achieve we propose relatively conservative thresholds for assessing whether a country has achieved uhc these thresholds lie at the lower end of the ranges of levels observed in countries that are generally recognized as having made considerable progress to uhc for outpatient services the threshold rate required would be visits per capita per year this compares with average rates of in oecd countries and rates of in developing countries with uhc for inpatient services we propose a rate of per people per year this is at the lower end of the range observed in both developed and developing countries with uhc today the oecd average is per who has proposed similar but higher levels in its sara tool we recognize that these measures of utilization provide no indication of the appropriateness or quality of care delivered nevertheless utilization levels below these targets will at least provide an indication of the extent of unmet need we recommend that each country supplement these utilization indicators with a critical analysis of the appropriateness of service use and quality of care delivered this draws on detailed assessments of minimum utilisation rates of appropriate services to address needed care within individual countries such as the need norms project in south africa rispel et al estimate utilisation rates for different categories of outpatient particularly phc services where there are minimal barriers to health services these estimates include preventive and promotive services e g number of visits to ensure full immunisation of children and antenatal care for pregnant women and curative care for acute and chronic conditions drawing on the demographic and epidemiological profile within that country appendix universal health care as being built on the foundation of human rights and equity whilst the health mdgs rightly encouraged overall improvements in population health outcomes concerns regarding equity within societies remained largely unaddressed large or growing health disparities have remained major barriers for realization of human capabilities and in the ability of people to live a life with dignity in essence this contradicts the shared fundamental value of equality that is espoused in the millennium declaration the universal declaration of human rights in recognized the right of everyone to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment sickness similarly the un international covenant on economic social and cultural rights of has guaranteed the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health both of these declarations have called for the creation of conditions which could assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness the sdgs offer another such opportunity however this would require a shared commitment to a global health development agenda that facilitates and promotes the development of health systems and policies guaranteeing all individuals accessible and affordable health including health prevention and promotion dimensions healthcare services and financial protection when needed these fundamental rights were recently re affirmed in a un general assembly resolution on uhc passed unanimously in december this resolution also explicitly recognized that inadequate coverage levels at present were compromising the attainment of these rights noting with particular concern that for millions of people the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health including access to medicines remains a distant goal that especially for children and those living in poverty the likelihood of achieving this goal is becoming increasingly remote that millions of people are driven below the poverty line each year because of catastrophic out of pocket payments for health care and that excessive out of pocket payments can discourage the impoverished from seeking or continuing care to redress this situation the recent un general assembly resolution emphasizes the importance of achieving universal population coverage specifically it acknowledges that universal health coverage implies that all people have access without discrimination to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive preventive curative and rehabilitative basic health services and essential safe affordable effective and quality medicines while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the users to financial hardship with a special emphasis on the poor vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population universal means that any strategy leaving any person especially people with greater needs or with fewer financial resources uncovered is unacceptable fulfilling this commitment does not imply using the same financing sources or same providers if economically advantaged sections of society choose to purchase health services using out of pocket financing or private insurance schemes then they should be free to do so however selective health strategies catering to the preferences of privileged groups and ignoring the needs of the poor are fundamentally inequitable and contravene rights based approaches the post development agenda must ensure that countries reach uhc equitably with health service benefits distributed according to need and pre paid financial contributions determined by ones ability to pay only then will health systems and policies be compatible with the core global values of freedom solidarity equality and human security which motivated the mdg process embedding progress towards attainment of uhc as a common global priority and development goal in the post mdg framework addresses the longstanding failure of the global development agenda to incorporate the internationally accepted right to health this right must guarantee effective and equitable access to healthcare services as well as security against financial risks from illness as basic elements of human wellbeing appendix examples of

Reduction": "global profile of extreme poverty background paper for the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda prepared by the secretariat of the sustainable development solutions network october poverty is multi dimensional in the simplest definition it is the lack of household income or consumption the world bank measures income or consumption poverty using a poverty line of per day in us purchasing power adjusted terms the headcount poverty rate or hpr measures the proportion of households in a country living below this international poverty line more generally poverty means the inability to meet basic needs including food shelter clothing water and sanitation education and healthcare in this sense poverty generally reflects a combination of income poverty at the household level and poverty at the community level in the provision of basic infrastructure and public services in principle a comprehensive poverty map would identify people living in poverty as a result of low household income or inadequate community services and would identify targeted solutions to poverty based on the precise nature of poverty this kind of analysis can be made at the local and national level but the requisite data do not exist at the global level there are several basic causes of extreme poverty these include adverse geographical condition physical isolation of the region landlocked small island mountainous and sparseness of the population poor climate hyper arid flood prone poor agriculture poor soils land degradation adverse climate or poor fisheries lack of energy resources no fossil fuels no hydro power disease ecology hyper endemic vector borne diseases such as malaria major vulnerability to hazards such as floods droughts typhoons earthquakes and other hazards the horn of africa and the sahel are examples of regions with highly adverse geographical conditions landlocked generally devoid of fossil fuels hyper arid and drought prone and endemic to tropical diseases including malaria and meningitis many small island states are geographically isolated within large middle income countries extreme poverty is often highest in remote interior provinces e g the west of china and the north east of india prolonged violent conflict and international sanctions the incidence of extreme poverty is highly correlated with violent conflict and instability afghanistan has been reduced to misery through thirty years of nearly continuous conflict likewise haitis economy was ravaged by repeated episodes of international sanctions despotic government and poor governance poor governance including high levels of corruption and the systematic misallocation of a countrys resources away from the needs of the poor are an important determinant of extreme poverty north korea is the quintessential case of despotic rule leading to extreme poverty despite otherwise favorable economic potential the failure by some of the resource rich countries in africa to use their relative wealth to overcome the disadvantages of unfavorable geography is another potent example of poor governance gender and ethnic or social discrimination indigenous peoples roughly million around the world and other excluded groups have faced centuries of extreme discrimination and social exclusion as a result they tend to live in the most remote parts of countries c f adverse geography above and constitute a particularly high share of the extreme poor particularly in asia girls and women continue to face extreme discrimination in social practices and legal rights e g the right to land title in many parts of the world which increases the risk of extreme poverty for households extreme total fertility rates or higher rural areas in many parts of sub saharan africa west asia and central asia have total fertility rates of or higher these higher tfrs result from culture religious tenets gender discrimination the lack of girls schooling high child mortality leading to high fertility choices of households and the unavailability of contraceptives and family planning services high tfrs are one of the most important determinants of extreme poverty since they reduce a households per capita investment in the health and education of its children as well as a governments per capita investments in infrastructure and social services that can reduce poverty lack of access to land while most of the rural poor in africa own too little land many extreme poor in south asia have no land title the lack of access to land and a lack of gainful employment opportunities can constitute an important driver of extreme poverty where the poor live using the world banks measure of extreme income poverty there are around billion people in extreme poverty around percent of those mainly in sub saharan africa live in low income countries as classified by the world bank below gdp per person in another percent mainly in asia live in lower middle income countries between and gdp per person such as china india and indonesia around percent of the extreme poor live in upper middle income countries the high proportion of the extreme poor living in middle income countries is not entirely surprising given that the mics account for approximately of the population of the developing world nor are the lower income countries that are home to the greatest proportion of the worlds poorest people safely out of the low income country zone where extreme poverty can be endemic india nigeria and many other lmics face enormous challenges of maintaining high and inclusive economic growth in view of highly challenging demographic environmental and social factors sub saharan africa remains the worlds poorest region and the one with the highest headcount poverty rate around south asia is second around and southeast asia is third there is scattered extreme poverty in other parts of the world such as in the andean highlands haiti indigenous communities in central america and small island states while these pockets of poverty pose serious humanitarian and social challenges for the people and places involved they are a small proportion of the overall global challenge table extreme income poverty poverty line of world bank region of worlds poor millions of poor sub saharan africa south asia east asia latin america and the

no june when we look across all poverty indicators in table sub saharan africa and south asia are the two centers of global poverty and the two regions demanding the most international support of these two regions sub saharan africa with lower income than south asia faces the greater challenge and need while the two regions account for approximately of the population of the developing countries they account for a much higher proportion of poverty in its various manifestations generally well over of the income poverty of the chronically hungry of the children out of school of the illiterate adults of the people living with hiv aids of the malaria deaths of the under mortality of the maternal mortality of those practicing open defecation of the stunted children where are the ultra poor it is difficult to accurately measure the distribution of poverty below the line several attempts have been made notably by ifpri who divide the poor into ultra poor below half the poverty line medial poor between half and of the poverty line and subjacent poor above of the poverty line the breakdown of poverty is summarized in figure we underscore the approximate nature of these calculations given the many uncertainties in the underlying data figure where the poor live in the developing world source akhter u ahmed ruth vargas hill doris m wiesmann the poorest and hungry looking below the line in joachim von braun ruth vargas hill rajul pandya lorch eds the poorest and hungry assessment analyses and actions ifpri washington d c sub saharan africa accounts for some of the worlds ultra poor these ultra poor exhibit all the attributes of the extreme poor described above but in greater depth they are located in the most remote areas part of excluded groups have extremely high tfrs and so forth as a result many find themselves in a poverty trap which they cannot exit without pro active anti poverty strategies anti poverty strategies the post goals should include the ambition to end extreme poverty this is certainly feasible by between and the hpr for the developing world declined from around to the conditions for reducing the hpr to near zero are propitious if the strategies are correct the nature of poverty and the policy implications are somewhat different in the cases of poor people in low income countries mainly sub saharan africa and poor people in lower middle income countries mainly in asia in the case of poor people in poor countries national government lacks the domestic resource base to break the poverty trap on their own moreover there may be few opportunities to relieve poverty through internal migration from poor regions to wealthier regions within the country such as from poor rural areas to dynamic urban areas in the case of poor people living in lower middle income countries by contrast national governments command more domestic resources for investing in poverty reduction and there may be more scope as well for internal migration typically from rural to urban areas for low income countries in sub saharan africa sub saharan africa faces an enormous burden of investment needs to build core infrastructure power roads rail water and sanitation fiber optics and more as well as the need to overcome deficits of energy disease burden irrigation and other climate vulnerabilities excessive fertility rates mean that sub saharan africas population around million is on a trajectory to exceed billion by on the uns medium fertility forecast a population anywhere near that level would spell devastation for africas ecosystems and its poor people especially in the face of growing risks from global human induced climate change the regions high priority anti poverty challenges include financing infrastructure electricity roads rail water and sanitation universal health care coverage reducing fertility rates to below from a current average of and much higher in rural areas universal access to schooling through secondary level upgrading rural agriculture through support for smallholder farmers improved governance and accountability to make the above possible all of these are actionable practical and feasible together they would enable both rural and urban africa to break out the poverty trap they require a mix of private and public financing infrastructure financing might need to increase by around billion per year mainly financed by private capital with some public sweeteners social spending might require a boost of around billion around half of which should come from official development assistance these countries should graduate from development assistance by for lower middle income countries in south and southeast asia these countries notably india indonesia pakistan and vietnam still have major pockets of poverty hundreds of millions of mainly rural people and often shockingly high levels of childhood under nutrition social programs need to be greatly enhanced and subsidy programs need to be much better targeted on the poor gender discrimination continues to impede progress for example in northern india countries with very high rates of stunting should focus on integrated strategies for early childhood development safe pregnancy and childbirth young childrens health and nutrition pre school and healthy childcare note that the countries of south and southeast asia are extremely vulnerable to global climate change all are densely populated with a high vulnerability to droughts floods and groundwater depletion some such as bangladesh would be devastated by a significant rise in the ocean level global climate change mitigation reducing the pace and extent of human induced climate change as well as domestic policies to promote climate resilience and

biodiversity and ecosystem services error marcador no definido key metrics error marcador no definido literature cited preface sustaining life the diversity of life on earth is our greatest asset in the campaign to achieve sustainable development found in every crevice and corner of every habitat on earth from the alpine tundra of the tibetan plateau to the deepest parts of the mariana trench millions of plant animal and microbial species work day in and day out providing us with benefits valued in the trillions of dollars much of these benefits are invisible such as maintaining earths stratospheric ozone layer that shields us from harmful radiation or pumping unwanted atmospheric carbon into the oceans depths or in the trees of a forest the productivity our forests farms and fisheries however are highly visible benefits they are the sources of our food fiber materials and fuels and the foundation of our health well being and national wealth and the more diverse they are the more productive and robust they will be thus preserving biodiversity and wisely managing our ecosystems ensures environmental sustainability which is the necessary precursor to achieving sustainable development it is important to note here that the sdsn fully supports the rio vision of sustainable development as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions of society economic development including the end of extreme poverty social inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance including peace and security life on earth however is undergoing significant change making the pathway to environmental sustainability extraordinarily challenging habitat degradation overfishing climate change and the human transport of invasive species pests and pathogens have led to enormous losses of forested ecosystems the collapse of major fisheries and the decline in the majority of services ecosystems provide fortunately biodiversity and ecosystem services have been under intense scientific investigation since following on the heels of the earth summit in rio today some solutions to the challenges of achieving environmental sustainability are to hand however much more can and needs to be done sustaining life as a thematic group a network of solutions achieving sustainable development is not just about economics and environment but about meeting a wide array of interconnected challenges these challenges include finding solutions to food energy and water security improving health alleviating hunger and poverty and wisely managing biodiversity and ecosystem services no single challenge among these will find its solution in isolation sustainable solutions to poverty health and hunger for example are strongly tied to solutions to securing ecosystem services such as the provisioning of food and materials by forests agro ecosystems the provisioning of water by watersheds healthy and productive ocean and coasts to mobilize science and technology and to accelerate problem solving for sustainable development the general secretary of the united nations has established the sustainable development solutions network sdsn jeffrey sachs serves as its director and guido schmidt traub its executive director and an executive committee and leadership council comprised of world leaders in sustainable development from across all sectors brought together to develop integrative solutions the solutions network is organized into twelve thematic groups box each representing a node made up of experts drawn from academia civil society local and indigenous representatives and the private sector to develop integrated solutions to the complex challenges that confront those working towards meeting sustainable development goals forests oceans biodiversity and ecosystem services fobes of the twelve thematic groups the one centered on biodiversity ecosystems and ecosystem services is entitled forest oceans biodiversity and ecosystem services fobes this thematic group serves as the network node for scientific and technical expertise centered on biodiversity and ecosystem services it interacts with all other sdsn nodes and serves all sectors seeking integrative solutions to sustainable development one of its chief functions is to help inform the establishment of goals targets and indicators in that sense the fobes thematic group has been actively involved in the preparation of the report prepared by the sdsn for the un secretary general an action agenda for sustainable development in particular the fobes group will contribute to bolster a discussion around potential targets and indicators to measure the success towards goal proposed by this action agenda secure ecosystem services and biodiversity and ensure good management of water and other natural resources box thematic groups of the sustainable development solutions network sdsn macroeconomics population dynamics health for all low carbon energy and sustainable early childhood development education poverty reduction and peace building in challenges of social inclusion gender inequalities and human rights and planetary boundaries and transition to work fragile regions it has also supported the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda the fobes thematic group draws its members from of academia civil society and the private sector who interact closely with members of the other thematic groups industry sustainable agriculture and food systems forests oceans biodiversity and ecosystem services sustainable cities inclusive resilient and good governance of extractive and land connected resources global governance and norms for sustainable development sustainable development redefining the role of business for it might not seem easy to connect forests savannas deserts coral reefs and kelp forests let alone wildlife and millions of species of insects known only to entomologists and a largely unexplored deep sea to human well being but they are closely linked to one another and humans in general because they are supplying the most important life support system somewhere on the order of ten million species populate earths ecosystems weighing at over a trillion tons of biomass half of which consists of beneficial microbes in our soils sediments and oceans these species cycle billions of tons of carbon nutrients and other elements among the biomes and ecosystems of the earth through their biological chemical and physical work this diversity of life on earth or biodiversity is what make our soils fertile water potable air breathable climate equitable and ecosystems productive they also regulate climate flooding the spread of infectious diseases and control agricultural pests invasive species and provide pollination services for our orchards and vegetable crops valuations of these services from greenhouse gas regulation by forests to markets for wild caught fish range in the billions sometimes trillions of dollars annually for individual services biodiversity ecosystem services and our basic livelihood and well being are inextricably linked the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services is complex but increasingly understood and new mechanisms for their inclusion into our markets and economies are under rapid development such as carbon trading and payment for ecosystem services there is a need to reduce transaction costs and increase the scale of pes schemes of the many biomes and ecosystems that make up the living earth forests and oceans are undergoing rapid change representing places where biodiversity and ecosystem services need urgent and special attention thus fobes though its domain encompasses all of life on earth emphasizes forest and ocean biodiversity and ecosystem functions when considering solutions for achieving sustainable development and environmental sustainability the work ahead the fobes thematic group aims to support the design and implementation of the sustainable development goals underlying key environmental conventions that address the global environmental commons these include the united nations convention on climate change unfccc the convention on biological diversity cbd the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and the convention to combat desertification unccd to name just a few biodiversity related agreements also the fobes thematic group will liaise with existing international research programs such as diversitas the united nations forum on forests unff the international council for science future earth icsu futureearth and the major global environmental assessments such as the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes and the world ocean assessment forests oceans biodiversity and ecosystem services illustrated is the diversity of life as an evolutionary tree that underlies the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide only three biomes are illustrated forests being converted to agriculture oceans whose resources are being unsustainably harvested and in the center grasslands being converted to grazinglands and pastures earths biogeochemistry which governs climate atmospheric composition soil fertility ocean productivity and much more is illustrated by elemental and nutrient cycling in the topmost layer this is the domain of fobes introduction the living world environmental sustainability on a rich and varied planet nature is complex diverse and highly dynamic and as much a source of our prosperity as it is a challenge to achieving a more equitable and sustainable world across the vast reaches of our planet no matter the scale whether from households to the biosphere people plants animals and the nearly invisible but ubiquitous microorganisms collectively produce a global environment that sustains all of life on earth in any given place at any given time life may be doing a poor job of insuring environmental sustainability creating conditions in which species perish energy and nutrients fail to cycle efficiently and ecosystems become fragile and incapable of tolerating environmental shocks in other places however ecological systems flourish they are productive and robust figure a rich and varied planet from ice caps to arid deserts to circulating oceans earth varies naturally in this image one can see the lights of the urban ecosystems of asia the extraordinarily diverse forests of southeast asia the ancient and arid continent of australia and the fact that three quarters of the world is ocean http earthobservatory nasa gov features bluemar ble images marble australia jpg figure a rich and varied planet from ice caps to arid deserts to circulating oceans earth varies naturally in this image one can see the lights of the urban ecosystems of asia the extraordinarily diverse forests of southeast asia the ancient and arid continent of australia and the fact that three quarters of the world is ocean http earthobservatory nasa gov features bluemar ble images marble australia jpg such ecological diversity such spatial and temporal variability among ecosystems is to be expected on a planet whose surface conditions range from ice covered poles to warm tropical seas fig as we move from the poles to the equator we encounter tundra boreal forests temperate forests grasslands deserts and rainforests as we move from east to west there are arid regions in the rain shadows of mountains lakes ponds rivers wetlands and bogs and when we reach the seas we encounter kelp forests and sea grass beds coral reefs the pelagic communities of the open sea and dark yet biologically diverse abyssal plains of the oceans floors we also encounter relatively young human dominated ecosystems such as farms forest plantations grazing lands pastures urban and suburban systems coastal harbors fish farms aquaculture production systems and in the oceans vast fleets of fishing vessels harvesting seafood from virtually every marine habitat although our living world is vast varied and seemingly incomprehensibly intricate the key to the environmental equitability and sustainability we seek is fairly basic the sum of ecosystems that function productively efficiently and robustly must equal or exceed the sum of those that do not that is over time negative outcomes of unsustainable management and environmental degradation must be countered by the positive influences of sustainable management and restoration while this truism is simple in principle in actuality perhaps the single most challenging scientific issue facing humanity is understanding how ten million species scattered over one hundred and fifty million square kilometers of land and suffused through billion so long as the extent of productive efficient and robust ecosystems cubic kilometers of water that covers three hundred and sixty million square kilometers or of earths surface with a total mass of living organisms weighing in at one trillion tons just in carbon and half of this mass consisting of microorganisms manages as a whole to function productively and efficiently over the long term over the short term the extent of productive and efficient ecosystems may or may not exceed the extent of those that are not but over the long term the net result is usually positive and earths ecosystems have collectively sustained life for billions of years so long as the extent of productive efficient and robust ecosystems exceeds the extent of unproductive inefficient and fragile ecosystems earth can continue to sustain an equitable environment support life and remain within safe planetary boundaries see fig below exceeds the extent of unproductive inefficient and fragile ecosystems earth can continue to sustain an equitable environment and remain within safe planetary boundaries new beginnings new commitments since the holocene a rather quiet and stable climatic epoch that started some twelve thousand years ago earth has changed dramatically in the last several decades human influences over biodiversity and ecosystem processes have led to a distinct epoch in earths history so much so that some now refer to our current times as the anthropocene the earth as influenced by human activities is characterized by anomalously high rates of extinction emerging diseases biotic exchange the spread of exotic and invasive species increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses global warming ocean acidification and dramatic alterations of earths hydrological and elemental cycles not just biologically important elements such as carbon nitrogen phosphorous and sulfur but fluxes of over sixty elements including toxic elements like mercury uranium and lead now exceed natural fluxes because of human activities that include mining construction industry farming and much more humans now also dominate geological processes moving more earth than occurs naturally and all this has happened only in a fraction of the time of the evolutionary process since the holocene actually only in the last part of the xviii century all these changes are attributable to human activities most of which have been directed to improve human wellbeing in some cases humans have managed ecosystems sustainably but since the industrial revolution or the s economic development has consisted of deforestation exceeding reforestation unsustainable extraction of marine biological resources to the point of several major fisheries are collapsing or on the verge of collapsing and many sources of unregulated pollution taking a business as usual approach is not tenable because if we continue to change the earth ecosystems are likely to suddenly collapse and earth itself could cross safe planetary boundaries fig fortunately humanity is working to follow new pathways in this early part of the anthropocene commitments to following more sustainable pathways to reduce the adverse environmental conditions we face today are many following the united nations un brundtland report our common future published in earth summits in and the millennium development goals mdgs and now proposals for the next generation of sustainable development goals sdgs nations around the world have committed to following alternative pathways of development ones that will ultimately lead to environmental sustainability biodiversity features prominently in such commitments and the convention on biological diversitys targets intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services mdg to ensure environmental sustainability and the proposed sdg to secure ecosystem services and biodiversity and ensure good management of water and other natural resources all demonstrate broad recognition of the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems for improving human wellbeing developments scorecard historically development was not always guided by a framework of sustainability until today much of human progress is attributable to unsustainable use of resources over exploitation of the ecosystems as a consequence biodiversity was reduced and the services that ecosystems are providing become increasingly under pressure initially because the supply far exceeded the demand when populations were small this development pathway worked well that we have reached seven billion people is testament to the extraordinary success of humanity during the course of what has proven ultimately to be unsustainable development the score card for humanitys success however is extraordinarily uneven advances in science technology and engineering have accelerated the acquisition and sharing of knowledge including access to remote natural resources maternal and infant health has seen marked increases and food production and food security has increased steadily a billion people however remain hungry today two billion are below the poverty line and three billion are without sufficient access to water and a number of social essentials such as education health care gender equity and security remain out of reach for the poor and vulnerable figure biodiversity and ecosystems a safe planetary boundary already crossed rockstrm and colleagues described levels of global environmental conditions that within which earth would probably function in a way that would sustain life of these current levels of biodiversity loss was deemed dangerously high or well above levels of loss that could be tolerated without jeopardizing robust functioning of earths many life support systems including global climate green regions represent safe planetary boundaries red indicates current values safe planetary boundaries have been crossed for seven of the nine illustrated in the figure modified from the original paper the world has committed itself to improving its scorecard as evidenced by the millennium development goals mdgs and now in the soon to be launched sustainable development goals sdgs we will need to have sustainable development strategies in place the collective will to stay the course and a global commitment to biodiversity and ecological preservation also it will be crucial to ensure wise management of all ecosystems especially forest and marine ecosystems for the developments scorecard in to show higher marks than it does today a fundamental framework for the st century ecosystems such as forests grasslands deserts wetlands and tundra on land or kelp forests coral reefs pelagic and abyssal plains in oceans constitute the natural foundation for human wellbeing the millennium ecosystem assessment a five year analysis by over social and natural scientists developed an elegant framework for understanding how our wellbeing is linked to nature put simply biodiversity ecosystem function ecosystem services human wellbeing this four part framework illustrated in figure captures the essential principles that govern our prosperity biodiversity or the ecological functional and genetic diversity of plants animals and microorganisms are what make an ecosystem function twenty years of research has confirmed that the greater the diversity of life the greater the magnitude and stability of ecosystem functions such as the production of biomass the cycling of key nutrients and the production and sequestration of greenhouse gasses a very simplistic global level this means that the performance of ecosystems is enhanced by having high biodiversity and diminished when biodiversity is reduced this perspective is simply a framework of analysis and the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services is far more nuanced than a linear function more research will need to be conducted to fully understand these complex relations for example biodiversity here is being considered as the diversity of species in the broadest sense of the term would also consider the diversity of biomes and the extent and distribution of unconverted habitats also while some fundamental processes of ecosystem functions such as food production increases in systems of lower diversity this is not true for all ecosystem functions and certainly not for all ecosystem services among ecosystem functions some clearly benefit humans in important ways such as food production watershed outflow soil production erosion control crop pollination the regulation of pests and pestilence and climate regulation without the reliable provisioning of such ecosystem services human wellbeing is jeopardized not just the obvious dimensions of human wellbeing such as having enough food and water but all dimensions that ultimately rest on environmental sustainability and security spatial and temporal variability define our planet and is the source of much of human cultural diversity as it is the source of much of biological diversity at all scales figure the modern framework for human wellbeing source global environmental outlook unep ecosystems earths environmental engines life is everywhere spatial and temporal variability define our planet and are the source of much of human cultural diversity sometimes called biocultural diversity and biological diversity at all scales temperature and photoperiod vary annually with latitude light under water diminishes dramatically as one moves from shallow coastal shelves to deeper waters on land topographic features create deserts in the rain shadows of mountains and alpine conditions as one moves up in elevation surface water salinity varies as one moves inland from the coast along mangrove forests and salt marshes these environmental gradients create myriad conditions that have resulted in millions of different kinds of species that vary enormously in their size shape physiology and other traits some land plants can tolerate salt drought and fire while others can live in perennially wet dark and cold cloud forests some fish like snail fish live almost eight kilometers below the sea while a small plane collided with a vulture in above the ivory coast west africa eleven kilometers above sea level the masters of living everywhere in even the most extreme environments are the microorganisms some of which live in crusts of hydrothermal vents beneath the sea some in crusts atop desert sands figure biomes ecosystems biodiversity and carbon biomes are climatically defined regions with characteristic vegetation and often characteristic animal diversity this figure illustrates the mass of life as measured by carbon content and how it is distributed on earth note how life is found virtually everywhere in spite of incredible variability in surface conditions e g icy poles to a warm equator ocean biodiversity is not illustrated but is of greater mass that is especially concentrated on continental shelves from http www carbon biodiversity net issues carbonstorage earths diversity in environmental conditions contributes not just to biological diversity but also to human cultural diversity not surprisingly cultural diversity such as our great lingual culinary and artistic diversity often correlates biological diversity in the same way that biodiversity is found in every habitat humans are found in most every terrestrial ecosystem from the arctic to the namibian desert and although humans do not live yet in oceans our massive impacts on marine resources inextricably links us to virtually all marine ecosystems in fact oceans are critical for our survival as they control the hydrological cycle including distribution of rain on land and its wast life in the oceans that created oxygen in the atmosphere upon which we are dependent in addition the ocean has taken up between a third and one half of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted to the atmosphere and in this manner impact radiative forcing and ameliorate climate change biodiversity and environment a two way interaction physical environmental conditions play dominant roles in governing where biodiversity and ecosystems are found but biodiversity and ecosystems also modify physical environmental conditions its a two way interaction earths climate is a result of solar orbital and planetary factors but it is also the result of many geochemical processes that are strongly modified by biological processes or biogeochemical processes nitrogen cycling for example the dominant gas in our atmosphere and a key element in soil fertility is almost entirely driven by microbial processes and microbial communities similarly terrestrial and marine ecosystems each contribute roughly equally to carbon cycling that influences how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses are in our atmosphere which strongly influences warming and global climate and oceans have absorbed nearly half the anthropogenic carbon dioxide since the industrial revolution another example of the complexity is an influence of marine life on precipitation through a complex web of biological processes oceanic organisms produce dimethyl sulfide a compound that often gives sea air its characteristic odor that is a key atmospheric aerosol which forms nuclei around which water vapor condensates forms droplets and eventually forms clouds that affect regional radiation and precipitation though the biological and physical worlds are inextricably bound to one another where any major change in one will lead to a major change in the other the processes involved are largely invisible without instrumentation one never sees the fluxing of greenhouse gases the cycling of nutrients or the millions of tons of microorganisms that make up the living world to the untrained eye many plants look alike so their diversity is not readily apparent most animals are small inconspicuous or simply live in places we are unlikely to see them such as life under the sea in the soils or in the canopies of forests we see the living world around us but not its diversity and not how it influences our environment much of lifes diversity and lifes processes may be invisible but without them our world would be incapable of sustaining life it takes life to sustain life perhaps the easiest way to see how dramatically biodiversity affects our environment is to compare our planet to its lifeless neighbors mars and venus fig take away photosynthesis nutrient cycling greenhouse gas regulation the production of biomass and much more and oxygen vanishes greenhouse gasses dominate the atmosphere temperatures soar and the planet becomes uninhabitable when we consider safe planetary boundaries it is not surprising that biodiversity loss is the most worrisome of all the boundaries we have crossed fig figure it is easy to see the two way interaction between life and our environment when we compare our home to our neighboring planets physical and chemical models of earth suggest that if we were to remove all of life from our planet it would eventually reach a chemical and physical equilibrium in which we looked like other rocky planets in our solar system most likely earth without life would have environmental conditions somewhere between venus left and mars right completely incapable of sustaining life at a planetary scale the lifeless hostile abodes of mars and venus show clearly the value of blue planet on earth the co existence of an atmosphere hydrosphere and geosphere have allowed ecosystems to develop which today provide all the essential life supporting services the to human race at local scales however bleached coral reefs covered in algae and devoid of fish dust storms over deserts created by overgrazing and landslides that often follow deforestation provide references for what happens when ecosystems are over exploited and biodiversity reduced keeping ecosystems from further degradation to barrens and wastelands unproductive oceans and toxic waste sites require different strategies policies goals targets indicators and solutions but the importance of resilient ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity remains the same across all scales a species rich planet is a healthier more resilient planet and a species rich ecosystem whether it is a farm city forest or ocean is typically healthier and more resilient dominant ecosystems in the pathway to sustainable development forests among terrestrial ecosystems our thematic group will pay special attention to forests as one of the worlds richest repositories of biodiversity a key source of ecosystem services for many nations and undergoing rapid change emphasis on forests in sustainable development is important the sustaining services that forests provide are critical to earths climate forests strongly influence earths hydrological cycles through the evapotranspiration of water through trees and regulation of water sheds their influence in carbon cycling is also well documented both of which are key elements in earths climate system the extent of forests is diminishing which means that their ability to function and provide important ecosystem services will be compromised in most cases forest loss is attributable to agricultural expansion not just logging on current trends agricultural expansion will reduce forest cover by per year until a trend that is exacerbated by dietary shifts towards greater consumption of livestock livestock products and vegetable oils as nations develop the amazon forest for example could decrease by by at current rates of agricultural expansion driven by growth in soybean and cattle production the story is similar for asia especially in the face of oil palm expansion and africa which is also losing forest to rising demands for timber and agricultural expansion oceans oceans are the primary regulator of the global climate and an important sink for greenhouse gases they provide us with water and the oxygen we breathe oceans and the many marine ecosystems are so vast that there was a sense that they are immune to the actions of humans however in many ways oceans are changing faster and more dramatically than their terrestrial partners for example over of the extra heat energy now stored near the earth s surface as a result of the changing concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contained in the ocean the ocean has taken up between a third and one half of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted to the atmosphere the dissolved carbon dioxide has lowed the oceans ph a process described at ocean acidification overall halpern estimated in that roughly of the global ocean is heavily affected by human activities some estimates place of our global biomass in the oceans and this mass accounts for half of global photosynthesis and respiration the processes that drive most ecosystem functions massive though this is major changes are in store in the face of anthropogenic climate change for example most models predict contraction of the productive sea ice biome and expansion of the less productive sub tropical gyre biome on a global level a decrease in primary production zhao and running fish biomass ransom and worm and whale abundance iwc has already been observed oceans are more than just fish stocks but fish represent a key connection between humanity and the oceans fish are important sources of protein for over billion people and fisheries and aquaculture employ nearly million people although expert calculations of the degree of overfishing vary official fao estimates show that roughly one quarter of all stocks are overfished about half of all stocks are fished with yields reaching their maximum capacity which without other stresses would be sustainable however reliable numbers on the state of stocks are only available for roughly of stocks currently fished upon oceans are also source of materials for many industries and transport across oceans is the most common cost effective means of global trade oceans are key sources of minerals and fossil fuels that we will in the near future exploit increasingly as technology for mining and extraction in marine habitats improves and arctic sea ice retreats impacts on our oceans are not just from such extractive industries but also marine traffic that accounts for over of global trade currently conducted by over sixty three thousand vessels marine pollution from land based sources is also widespread and increasing at rapid rates sources and types of marine pollution vary from heavy metals and radioactive material to plastic nutrient runoff and untreated sewage that can lead to eutrophication and well known dead zones and harmful algal blooms hab some of the worst regions being western zhao maosheng and steven w running drought induced reduction in global terrestrial net primary production from through science no myers ransom a and boris worm rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities nature no iwc international whaling commission http iwc int estimate europe the eastern and southern coasts of the u s and east asia particularly japan hypoxia and hab deteriorate the quality of water and can change or reduce species diversity or cause the deaths of fish birds and marine mammals when toxins are produced on top of natural resource extraction marine traffic and pollution climate change is taking its toll and likely to irrevocably alter ocean biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide increased co concentration in the atmosphere is leading to increased uptake of co by the ocean leading to ocean acidification ocean surface ph has already lowered e g become more acidic by ph compared to pre industrial values and is expected to further decrease by an additional units by which would be the lowest value registered in the last million years the impacts of ocean acidification are still under investigation but it clearly poses a threat to the abundance health physiology and biogeochemistry of several key marine species and their food webs prominent examples are coral reefs shellfish and calcareous plankton the base of much of the marine food chain some predictions say that if current co emission rates continue unabated then there will be no regions in the world s ocean at all where conditions are predicted to be able to support the net growth of coral skeletons by the mid s coral reef degradation especially when degradation leads to loss of reef mass would reduce protection for shorelines from erosion and flooding and impact local fisheries tourism and recreation industries as well as related maritime economies currently it is not certain whether marine species and ecosystems will be able to adapt to changes in ocean chemistry but due to the fact that ph values have dropped remarkably in the last century there is great concern about ocean acidification threats that could alter marine food webs which could have far reaching consequences for the oceans and millions of people depending on them for food resources global warming can lead to stratification and the formation of anaerobic conditions where seawater contains virtually no oxygen and most living organisms perish in summary though people do not actually live in the ocean atmosphere land and ocean are so tightly coupled that environmental sustainability is not achievable unless marine conservation and stewardship are integral parts of sustainable development pathways fobes sustainable development solutions initiating the process central to identifying solutions to the challenges of transitioning from traditional development to sustainable development through the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services is providing a single guiding framework the millennium ecosystem assessment mea for example developed its guiding overarching framework as its first step securing biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides requires an integrative social natural science framework this framework would identify major classes of ecosystem services key classes of social and natural drivers of change and quantifiable linkages among them these drivers and linkages represent the foci for the development of coupled social natural models quantitative metrics and policy relevant indicators that will be necessary for the development and implementation of solutions for achieving sustainable development this integrative social natural science framework illustrated in figure considers all ecosystems residing on a scale that spans natural unmanaged systems at one end and managed e g agro ecosystems pastures rangelands agroforestry urban areas on the other unmanaged and managed ecosystems therefore represent endpoints of a continuum and no ecosystem is likely to represent either extreme all ecosystems are either directly managed by humans whether they are marine protected areas or wildlife reserves likewise all managed systems have some components most often microbial communities and invertebrates that are not directly managed but which still respond indirectly to human management in the fobes framework unmanaged systems are shown as those primarily providing regulating e g pollination soil stabilization and resilience against natural disasters cultural e g recreational and inspirational values and supporting services e g nutrient cycling and soil production and are the principle repositories for earths biodiversity but they provide insufficient food fiber or fuel provisioning services in contrast managed systems primarily provide provisioning services but at a cost to biodiversity and other services note that implicit in this framework is the integration of ecological knowledge methods in practices such as agriculture pastoralism and forestry in the social natural component figure ecosystem transitions between natural and managed systems fobess framework adapted from naeem et al and congruent with clark and levin considers ecosystems ranging from managed to unmanaged though in reality no ecosystem is independent of human influence two ecosystems are illustrated unmanaged on the right and after human induced transitions managed on the left the double arrow indicates that ecosystems can exist anywhere along a gradient of management and can move in either direction depending on human decisions and actions note that the quantity of different ecosystem services and biodiversity change along the management gradient but remain connected to global circulations and global trade transportation and travel in the fobes framework fig social natural factors and drivers divide into three categories social cultural such as economic political and behavioral such as shifting diets to more or less meat agricultural forestry such as yield gaps irrigation and cropping efficiencies plantation forests natural forest management and natural such as biodiversity climate and nutrient cycling and extreme weather events although the relative magnitude and stability of services provided by ecosystems vary all ecosystems supply the same complement of services but managed systems often optimize provisioning services at the cost of supporting regulating and cultural services in that sense it would be useful to systematize and disseminate the sustainable ways to produce services it is crucial to stress that both the framework and the solutions we propose are to initiate the process fobes members will work precisely on developing its framework and solutions in collaboration with other thematic groups also the fobes framework will inspire itself on the exiting work such as the conceptual framework for ipbes from a conceptual point of view managed ecosystems need to be improved so as to increase their regulation services there are many cases of agricultural practices that can lead to increased soil carbon socks such as low tillage agriculture that also reduces erosion and protects watersheds unmanaged ecosystems need to have their regulating and cultural services valued economically like areas protected by indigenous communities for spiritual or cultural reasons for example the value of these services produced by protected areas should be recognized and result in better public and private funding for their protection fobes areas of action and recommendations action area reduce agricultural expansion by improving efficiency more efficient agro ecosystems that require less external inputs e g biocides water and fertilizers can substantially reduce agricultural expansion at the expense of natural forest and savannas in developing countries where agriculture is dominated by smallholder farming emphasis should be placed on bolstering bottom up solutions such as providing improved technical assistance improved access to credit payments for avoided deforestation and ecosystem services traditional conservation friendly farming practices farmer cooperatives and more consistent environmental law enforcement in developed countries where agriculture is dominated by carbon intensive production systems emphasis should be given to technological solutions that reduce input demand and revert perverse government incentives and subsidies as well as domestic and international consumer pressures against unsustainable agricultural products and innovative tax policies also nutrient burdens from agricultural run off fertilizer manure has led to continued growth in the occurrence of coastal hypoxic zones and economic damages approaching usd billion per year in the eu alone the need to begin a transition to much more cyclic management of nutrients whereby efficiency of fertilizer use is increased and the majority of human and livestock waste nutrients are recovered and reused for fertilizer and other needs in parallel some analyses project that available phosphorus reserves could run out as early as this century with unprecedented effects on global food security whether it is this soon or somewhat longer doesnt negate the fact that eventually phosphorus recovery from the waste stream will need to become the norm not the exception if long term global food security is to be ensured un blueprint on ocean and coastal sustainability north south technology transfers have often resulted in problems for tropical agriculture south south technology exchanges should be greatly encouraged a success story of how research can help increase agricultural productivity is the case of embrapa brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa is a governmental research institution focused on technology development that has played a key role in increasing the productivity of many agricultural products in brazil through the development and spread of new products and technologies for example the area designated for the production of grains and vegetable oil seeds in brazil increased in while production increased in and incomes increased times action area decoupling economic development from deforestation one of the most important challenges of sustainable development is to decouple economic development from deforestation this is particularly important for countries in which agriculture plays an important role in the economy a noteworthy example is brazil a country with the largest area of tropical forest in the world and in which agriculture plays an important role in the national economy in the agribusiness sector agriculture and cattle ranching in brazil represented of the countrys gdp brazil has reduced amazonian deforestation by over between and while increasing its gdp fig since in the state of par in the brazilian amazon municipalities have also started to implement policies to reduce deforestation through a program called green municipalities which emphasizes integrating land tenure and environmental planning shared environmental management and supporting sustainable production to meet ambitious but realistic targets policies to reduce deforestation should consider five important elements the establishment of protected areas in collaboration with local and indigenous communities conventional command and control fines apprehension of illegal goods and products such as wood financial and commercial disincentives for those who deforest illegally economic incentives to sustainable forest economies and financial incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation through payment for ecosystem services however such initiatives should separate their focus on industrial and corporate groups from poor smallholders in terms of the management approaches used as well as the financial incentive and disincentive structures employed there is a need to have a poverty focus as a way to link these activities with the boarder goal of reducing social inequity once again the amazon serves as an example such as the bolsa floresta program that incorporated these five elements additionally international support such as norways donations to the amazon fund can facilitate such programs by adding incentives that reduce deforestation and participation by civil society also played an important role by running highly visible campaigns that applied political pressure on governments and businesses to support sustainability these activities led to a soybean moratorium a commitment signed by large companies not to buy from soybean producers who engaged in deforestation in the amazon reduction of deforestation can also be reached with good forest management a good example is the one of the community concessions in petn guatemala in the dry season the fires occur in the core zone and the buffer zone of the mayan biosphere reserve while the multiple use zone in which certified forest management occurs almost no fires happen because the forest have a value for the communities and they protect it figure annual deforestation rate in the amazon and growth in gross domestic product gdp in brazil between and indonesia is another noteworthy case a country with the third largest area of tropical forests after brazil and democratic republic of congo agriculture like in many other tropical nations is an important source of revenue in indonesia representing of the countrys gdp palm oil in particular represents to of the indonesian gdp while forestry harvesting and silviculture contributes approximately indonesia has recently implemented a new set of policies aimed at reducing deforestation and degradation as a part of a national redd strategy this includes i a moratorium on new concessions which suspends the granting of new concession licenses for logging and conversion of forests and peat lands signed in mid and protects million hectares avoiding the emission of estimated giga tons of coe to the atmosphere ii the establishment of national emissions reduction target of to iii the establishment of a national redd strategy which is one of the outputs foreseen by the redd task force created by a presidential decree in to prepare the countrys redd infrastructure and iv a landmark policy to recognize indigenous peoples rights over forests action area develop economic instruments for ecosystem services valuing nature has both supporters and detractors but in many cases governmental and non governmental institutions land owners managers urban planners and most stakeholders require ways in which ecosystem services can be understood in economic terms ecosystem services sometimes referred to as environmental or natures services are difficult to value but tremendous progress has been made the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity teeb initiative for example has drawn considerable attention to the economic benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services teeb has developed clear concise and consistent approaches for assessing and incorporating the values of biodiversity and ecosystem services into decision making often through incentives and price signals teeb emphasizes the importance of both benefits and costs of economic development which too often focuses solely on benefits without accounting for societal costs the economic benefits of agricultural expansion for example are often not weighed against the benefits derived from sustainable forestry in terms of timber and non timber forest products such as fruits and fiber payment for ecosystem services pes programs are among the most rapidly growing mechanisms for enabling ecosystem service markets pes programs can be devised to insure that both buyers and sellers can participate in the trade of ecosystem goods and services pes is especially important for biodiversity conservation which is traditionally done by governments and ngos but most of the land where biodiversity resides is outside of such protection by one estimate pes programs for biodiversity could benefit million low income households in developing countries pes for carbon could benefit an additional million households pes for watershed protection benefit another million and pes for cultural ecosystem services benefit yet another million households costa rica for example in implemented a tax on fossil fuels to balance the benefits of industrial development with the costs of degradation of ecosystem services and created the fondo nacional de financiamiento florestal fonafifo to provide financial support to forest owners and indigenous peoples to conserve and sustainably manage forested areas or to reforest degraded land since its creation with an annual budget currently between us million year which corresponds to around of the countrys gdp the program has resulted in nearly contracts covered nearly hectares of forests and distributed almost us million still in costa rica pes is considered only one of the many policy mechanisms and instruments of sustainable development available in addition to this climate smart agriculture csa is an important component of a sustainability strategy to deal with food production and forest protection csa is a concept based in three pillars sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes adaptation and building resilience to climate change and reducing and or removing ghg emissions csa is an important mechanism to increase efficiency in food production tackling food security reducing ecological footprint and adapting to climate change scenarios catie is developing a wider concept named as climate smart territories because the territorial approach follows better the path of the adaptive mosaic of the millennium ecosystems assessment in a same territory several realities coexist in time agriculture cattle farming cities forests and it is necessary to take actions regarding all land uses no only in agriculture the world economic forum estimates that agriculture is responsible for of ghg emissions forestry is responsible for ghg and agriculture is responsible for of worldwide employment when climate varies crop losses can be enormous and in some regions such as the sahelian countries crop losses can range from to in the face of drought these estimates vary according to different sources but the general split is consistent in the various reports agriculture also consumes of the fresh water we mobilize from natural sources better management systems and technology use could dramatically improve food provisioning from agro ecosystems while not jeopardizing services provided by unmanaged ecosystems by minimizing or eliminating agricultural expansion following the water footprint networks report agriculture consumes m of water for ton of cereal the target is to reduce this by half m ton of cereal by this can be accomplished basically by implementing three integrated actions i improving the diversity of crops by agro ecological systems ii providing capacity building for such small and medium farmers and iii fostering credit and other incentives for this transition financial and non financial incentives are needed for climate smart agriculture therefore policy frameworks are much needed especially in least developed countries where agriculture plays an important role within national gdp these frameworks are essential to reduce the ecological footprint reduce pressure on forests and help meet growing demands for food production however the effect of ecosystem services on human wellbeing cannot be quantified through purely economic approaches alone although these form an important component of solutions focused planning thus it is important to supplement the use of economic valuation and economic instruments with a focus on cultural and social ecosystem services which are often much more locally variable and socially stratified within locations thus difficult to quantify a focus on quantification should not obscure the importance of such cultural and social ecosystem services for human wellbeing especially but not exclusively for disadvantaged communities such as indigenous groups women and the poor action area emphasize the participatory process people play important roles as providers of ecosystem services but their roles are often neglected in sustainable development indigenous and traditional populations have some of the worst health and education indicators and stand to benefit the most from achieving sustainable development indigenous knowledge though limited in some regards reflects knowledge accumulated over long periods passed from one generation to the next and reflects knowledge on time scales that better reflect ecological time scales rather than timescales of typical western research years for terrestrial freshwater marine ecosystems examples of inclusion of indigenous people in ecosystem service sustainable development programs are the vanguard proposition of coordination of the indigenous peoples of the amazon coica an umbrella organization for all indigenous peoples of the nine countries of the amazonian ecosystem coica has formulated the redd indigena their own version of how a united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc mechanism should work in contrast to redd the redd indigenas strategy is to contribute to global strategies for mitigation in adaptation in a way that strengthens ecosystem functions on earth through the holistic management of indigenous territories it aims to establish a full life plan for the long term guarantee the tenure rights of indigenous people promote a holistic management that integrates mitigation and adaptation to climate change sustainably manage biodiversity provide financial compensations based on public funds and ensure social control over development by directly addressing the drivers of deforestation such as oil mining timber harvesting and other extractive industries as well as agricultural expansion indigenous populations inhabit most remaining tropical forests thus it is important to recognize the rights of these people to resources in their homelands countries such colombia equator and brazil have gone a long way in recognizing these rights and progress is being made in countries such as indonesia where the rights of indigenous peoples to forest resources have recently been legally established there are still vast forest areas where unclear forest tenure leads to social conflicts crime and extreme poverty a successful approach to ensure appropriate participation of local people is through adaptative management approach at the territorial level a noteworthy case is the iberoamerican model forests newtwork that includes territories in countries with more than million ha this is part of an international effort of a bottom up process to get the sustainable human development of forest rich territories currently led by catie action area expand biodiversity and ecosystem function service research funding for biodiversity research is frequently among the smallest portion of research and development budgets most countries have departments or ministries for agriculture forestry fisheries or the environment but allocation of resources to biodiversity and ecosystem service research is negligible even in the united states for example where annual federal spending on research and development is billion less than is invested in biodiversity research nations with smaller budgets for research and development spend even less this low allocation stems largely from a historical and traditional perspective in which biodiversity is seen primarily as an abstract topic with little application in comparison to biology chemistry or physics where links to medicine and engineering are well accepted biodiversitys link to human wellbeing economic development and environmental sustainability are now well understood and research in biodiversity and ecosystem service research needs to expand to become comparable to other investments in scientific research while the acceleration of research on all ecosystems would provide immense benefits for people forests and marine ecosystems should take priority three basic investments in biodiversity research will have enormous benefits compared to costs these are complete the inventory of every nations plant animal and microbial diversity across three dimensions of biodiversity taxonomic e g the number of species functional e g the diversity of traits such as body size metabolic rates and nutrient and water use efficiency and phylogenetic e g evolutionary such inventories are critical starting points for developing strategies and policies for achieving environmental sustainability through natural resource conservation and management such inventories will of course miss the important point species presence does not guarantee that they are functioning in ecosystems providing services or likely to persist if their numbers are low wherever possible estimates of abundance are important conduct global and national assessments and inventories of ecosystem services such information is necessary for economic valuation and for understanding the true economic impact of development across all scales development strategies for example that invest in one ecosystem service e g agriculture focuses on provisioning services ecotourism focuses on cultural services will invariably lead to losses in other services but assessments and inventories can be used to prevent such outcomes the challenge faced will be to sustain observations and build capacities in those countries that need it this might be particularly difficult with maritime nations where ocean research is costly increase education and training in basic applied and integrative where basic is linked to applied issues biodiversity research including the links of biodiversity with social sciences by making basic and applied biodiversity science part of grade school educational curricula by ensuring that universities have programs in biodiversity research and by creating investing in or incentivizing individuals to make biodiversity part of their career development we can help to create the new environmental workforce necessary to integrate biodiversity into policy and practice those taking up careers in agriculture would benefit learning about agro biodiversity and non agricultural ecosystem services while those learning forest ecology would benefit by working with foresters and forest extension agents marine fisheries scientists would benefit from learning about the role of marine biodiversity including microorganisms in ecosystem services and would work with fishing industries as well as local fishers to develop sustainable harvest strategies and conserve natural marine resources to achieve this we need to coordinate research with national and regional centers develop better technologies to monitor and manage biodiversity and ecosystem services and work to build better good management practice action area develop smart ecosystem governance of terrestrial ecosystems new forms of governance are needed in order to establish sustainable development solutions for ecosystems while governments have the fundamental role of establishing legal frameworks private sector and ngos can bring much needed efficiency creativity and innovation as well as linking to consumers and civil society it is not always clear however how ecosystem governance should combine top down e g law enforcement with bottom up e g participatory decision making ecosystem governance involves nut just controlling the harvesting of goods e g timber fish fodder but managing and overseeing many elements of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to ensure that goods and services are provided in a sustainable way such a broad remit would seem to require governments that can levy taxes for ecosystem service use to generate revenue for management something ngos and the private sector cannot do further since ecosystem services include regulatory services that reduce environmental risks ecosystem governance could fall under national insurance programs and again be appropriately managed by governments in contrast ecosystem governance might be better run by a bottom up approach where indigenous knowledge better serves management smart ecosystem governance would reflect new approaches rather than traditional dichotomy of top down or traditional bottom up governance because most land is not owned by the state in many developing countries and because marine ecosystems are governed weakly neither national nor international governance may be appropriate for ensuring sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services on the other hand because many indigenous populations are impoverished and sometimes marginalized by state governments they may lack the authority institutions and resources necessary for effective governance of ecosystems clearly new innovative approaches to ecosystem governance need to be developed approaches in which the strengths inherent in both top down and bottom up approaches are brought together a good example of mechanisms for working towards smart governance are roundtables such as roundtable on sustainable palm oil global roundtable for sustainable beef and the roundtable on responsible soy these cases show how private companies can engage with civil society and producers to collaborate and improve sustainability on such production chains implement best practices and guarantee compliance of the sectors another case is the governance structure of the fonafifo see solution above in this initiative governments ngos and private companies work together to channel funds from taxes and private business to rural producers who conserve or restore their properties another good example is the model forest system with an international network divided into regional networks is a bottom up approach but within the national regulations and international initiatives thus considering also top down elements of the equation action area improve management and governance of oceans oceans which comprise two thirds of the earths surface and provide crucial global ecosystem services need special attention oceans as the worlds largest global commons urgently require activities that work across government ngo private and other sectors there are few examples of promising initiatives that need to be reinforced there are several agencies such as the intergovernmental oceanographic commission of unesco the north pacific marine science organization pices international council for the exploration of the sea ices the united nations international maritime organization imo international institute of fisheries economics trade iifet and the international whaling commission that bring together different sectors concerning marine science conservation and policy but they lack regulative authority abilities to develop and employ pes programs smart governance of marine sustainable development however needs to go beyond these efforts over the intervening years of implementing sdss we will need to improve and harmonize legal frameworks for oceans and coasts and ensure that they take into account current and future uses of marine resources by the complex international set of stakeholders achieving smart marine sustainable development governance will also have to focus on ensuring that coastal communities remain resilient through climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies by funding the development of new and innovative means for achieving marine sustainable development and by ensuring that costs benefits and responsibilities are shared among all parties these activities require the sort of integrated and multi level ocean governance that is currently absent smart sustainable development solutions couple marine and terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services critical to developing smart marine sustainable development governance will be developing a framework for marine spatial planning msp marine spatial planning msp is a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean including energy industry government conservation and recreation to make informed and coordinated decisions about how to use marine resources sustainably msp is already being used within exclusive economic zones eezs however it will be necessary to extend it to areas beyond national jurisdiction furthermore marine ecosystems will similarly require smart development of its biodiversity and ecosystem services though the massive scale and complex international governance issues of open ocean systems will require considerable investment to develop and implement tractable solutions guiding principles for smart sustainable development solutions for oceans will be to first ensure that basic life sustaining and regulating functions of the oceans oxygen production key processes in the climate system and in the hydrological cycle are not jeopardized by development this will require developing multi sectorial roundtables and authoritative bodies that can regulate development activities that alter these functions such activities may not be limited to marine ecosystems management since fish consumption and markets marine shipping traffic and vessel regulations agricultural runoff and pollution are often partially or wholly terrestrially based similarly climate change mitigation efforts that limit carbon dioxide emissions derived primarily from fossil fuel burning and forest degradation though terrestrial activities are important for preventing further ocean warming acidification and deoxygenation smart sustainable development solutions couple marine and terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services a second guiding principle to smart marine sustainable development is to ensure healthy and productive marine environments meaning that all ocean and coastal provisioning and non provisioning services are considered smart marine sustainable development solutions should not be just about fish for example but about ensuring that the exploitation of all living marine resources are held within safe biological limits because oceans are severely impacted by extractive industries on non living resources such as minerals and fossil fuels they should be integral parts of solutions likewise the use and protection of sensitive marine areas the development and distribution of technical capacities for the sustainable use of ocean resources and providing access to marine information and data to build global capacity for the transparent and open assessment and monitoring of ocean resources will be instrumental to building effective solutions that will require regularly updated status reports of ocean and coastal sdg indicators all solutions should be in accordance with the ecosystem approach and the precautionary principle efforts should be made for urgent implementation of the provisions of the convention of biological diversity which calls for a major increase in marine protected areas up to of ocean by these protected areas should be implemented by national governments in national waters near the coast and by international organizations in

development goal september in june three major reports on the post development agenda were issued by the sustainable development solutions network sdsn the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda and the global compact all three reports agree that the post development agenda needs to focus on sustainable development and finish the job of ending extreme poverty in all its forms each report underscores the importance of cities and urban development but they differ markedly in how they propose to address urban issues in the design of sustainable development goals sdgs only the sdsn proposes a stand alone urban goal while the other reports suggest that urban challenges be addressed as part of sectoral goals and targets the un secretary generals report to the general assembly issued in july also highlights the importance of sustainable cities and the positive role of sdsn members and partners in paving the way forward towards a post agenda this note outlines the case for a stand alone urban sdg it explains why alternative approaches that treat urbanization as a cross cutting issue and spread urban issues across separate goals for infrastructure social services and environmental sustainability would fail to mobilize cities or address the essential role that urbanization must play in sustainable development note prepared by the sdsn thematic group on sustainable cities supported by un habitat uclg cities alliance iclei and metropolis available at www unsdsn org www posthlp org and www globalcompact org in this document we use the terms cities and urban areas interchangeably to denote metropolitan areas and all urban centers that have economic or political importance available at http www un org ga search view doc asp symbol a urbanization and sustainable development urbanization will be the defining trend over the next several decades especially in east asia south asia and sub saharan africa where the bulk of extreme poverty is concentrated cities in these and other regions will play a central role in the ability of nations to achieve sustainable development today half the worlds seven billion people live in cities by there will be over one billion more urban residents and for the first time ever in many parts of the world the number of rural residents will start to shrink between and the urban population will grow significantly by to billion people increasing the urban share to two thirds of the worlds population urbanization has the ability to transform the social and economic fabric of nations cities are responsible for the bulk of production and consumption worldwide and are the primary engines of economic growth and development roughly three quarters of global economic activity is urban and as the urban population grows so will the urban share of global gdp and investments the right to development for low income and middle income countries can only be realized through sustainable urbanization that addresses the needs of both rural and urban areas it must also be recognized that cities are home to extreme deprivation and environmental degradation with one billion people living in slums in many countries the number of slum dwellers has increased significantly in recent years and urban inequality is deepening the dynamism of cities represents a major sustainable development opportunity by getting urban development right cities can create jobs and offer better livelihoods increase economic growth improve social inclusion promote the decoupling of living standards and economic growth from environmental resource use protect local and regional ecosystems reduce both urban and rural poverty and drastically reduce pollution sound urban development will accelerate progress towards achieving sdgs including the end of extreme poverty on the other hand mistakes made in managing urban growth are very hard to undo infrastructure investments urban land use systems and layouts are literally cast in stone with impacts that may be difficult to alter for many decades without adequate management and investments slums may expand and cities may fail to generate the jobs necessary to improve livelihoods as a result inequalities exclusion and violence may increase countries may fail to decouple economic development from resource use and cities may fail to provide economic opportunities to surrounding rural areas and become vulnerable to climate and other environmental changes cities around the world are struggling to accommodate their rising populations and address the multi dimensional challenges of urban development if current trends continue few countries stand to reap the benefits of sustainable urban development the stakes are high how the sdgs address the urban challenge and how cities promote a shift away from business as usual is of paramount importance to the post development agenda why the world needs an urban sdg a dedicated and stand alone urban sdg will accomplish the following educate and focus attention on urgent urban challenges and future opportunities the millenium development goals mdgs have successfully educated leaders and the public about important dimensions of extreme poverty the sdgs must similarly educate leaders and the public and focus their attention on the urgent challenges and opportunities of sustainable urban development from to in order to improve the lives of slum dwellers provide access to basic infrastructure services protect local and regional ecosystems and ensure resilience the need to educate leaders and the public on re imagining sustainable urban development pathways is particularly urgent because cities as usual will not suffice despite strong track records of many local governments cities in general are not well equipped to address emerging urban challenges they are under resourced and disempowered many lack the competencies needed to address the complex multi sectoral challenges they face poor cities are contending with rising populations inadequate infrastructure and basic services and increasing pollution many rich cities face challenges of shrinking populations a shrinking economic and livelihood base aging infrastructure and the need to meet lifestyle aspirations within planetary boundaries unless these challenges are addressed many poor and rich cities could lock themselves into an unsustainable and unlivable future mobilize and empower all urban actors around practical problem solving the challenges and opportunities presented by urbanization are complex and context specific success will require practical problem solving the sdgs must mobilize all urban actors including local authorities mayors urban ngos and community organizations universities businesses and national authorities to respond to the challenge and opportunity of global urbanization a dedicated urban sdg is needed to mobilize all of these urban stakeholders to act in concert in the absence of a dedicated goal the sdgs are unlikely to promote the improvements in governance needed by both rich and poor cities alike today local authorities businesses and community organizations that should be working together to address urban challenges are often at loggerheads and acting in isolation outcomes of academic studies on urban sustainability dont always reach decision makers a dedicated urban sdg will highlight the challenges and opportunities of urban governance that must be addressed if cities are to prosper such a goal will empower city governments and support inclusiveness by empowering community organizations and a broad range of urban stakeholders to demand sound governance it will mobilize public private partnerships and help build a bridge across the rural urban divide address the specific challenges of urban poverty and access to infrastructure the characteristics of urban poverty differ in several ways from rural poverty in urban settings the extreme poor must pay for food water fuel housing and other basic needs that typically cost less in rural areas while per day may be a good definition of extreme poverty in largely rural areas this threshold is often too low in cities likewise several indicators for access to and use of basic infrastructure services have been designed for rural settings and are not suited for an urban context these definitional and measurement issues have major policy implications they point to the need for a dedicated urban sdg to sharpen the focus on better ways to address urban poverty access to infrastructure and basic services housing and security of tenure and the institutional arrangements needed to fund implement and track progress in meeting these objectives well run cities are proven fighters of poverty an urban sdg will enable an integrated approach to improving the lives of the urban poor particularly slum dwellers the mdgs showed the benefit of focusing on slum dwellers but despite improvements in the lives of millions increased urbanization and a rapidly growing poor urban population has resulted in an increase in the overall number of slum dwellers worldwide an urban sdg is needed to more systematically address the dynamic nature of urbanization create opportunities for change for the urban poor such as targeted investment in slum areas and create a space for their engagement and participation in local decision making and institution building promote integrated and innovative infrastructure design and service delivery the challenges faced by cities are interconnected and must be dealt with in an integrated manner innovative infrastructure design modern technology solutions and smart systems offer tremendous opportunities for improving access to basic services and lowering their cost increasing efficiency reducing per capita consumption of environmental resources and reducing pollution these opportunities can only be seized through integrated infrastructure planning processes that span multiple services water and sanitation energy transport broadband communications and housing integration must occur at the city level and will be promoted by a dedicated urban sdg promote land use planning and efficient spatial concentration the spatial concentration of urban areas is a unique characteristic that enables economies of scale and scope efficient delivery of services and effective use of amenities however urban land use is often growing more rapidly than urban populations leading to an urban density decline in many parts of the world good spatial planning can minimize urban land use footprints and increase the efficiency of service provision well planned mixed use and compact cities generally offer higher levels of well being at lower levels of resource use and emissions an urban sdg is needed to converge land use planning with economic development livelihood creation and the delivery of sustainable transportation energy water and communications infrastructure an urban sdg will promote effective and integrated management of cities suburban peri urban and exurban areas as well as effective management of urban ecosystems and rural development ensure resilience to climate change and disaster risk reduction cities are responsible for the majority of global greenhouse gas emissions as well as much of the activity to reduce such emissions at the same time they are particularly vulnerable to temperature rise flooding rising sea levels and extreme weather events integrating resilience planning and disaster risk reduction into city management and infrastructure design requires site specific strategies and city level targets that are best promoted through an urban sdg what would an urban sdg mean for different stakeholders interventions national governments will be called on to support local governments many local governments have a strong positive track record of promoting sustainable development an urban sdg will support these efforts and provide higher visibility with national governments donors and private sector investors an urban sdg will support local governments in taking decisive action to implement multiple targets that cut across sectors and institutions with the support of national governments international agencies and most importantly local agents of change from the private and civil society sectors universities and common citizens national governments an urban sdg will provide an opportunity to establish coherent national policies for urban issues promote regulatory frameworks facilitate investment planning and coordinate multiple sectoral local city governments in achieving urban targets and will benchmark and monitor national and city level progress in meeting them enabling more effective sdg implementation private sector the private sector ranging from household enterprises to transnational corporations will rally around an urban sdg to promote the financing and delivery of infrastructure goods and services enhance urban governance and strengthen measures to reduce climate and disaster risk civil society cities are the crossroads where diverse cultures meet and are therefore prime locations for demonstrating innovative social and cultural institutions an urban sdg will open up a space for engagement and participation in local decision making cultural exchange and understanding and enable civil society to connect with the informal and community sector it will provide a framework for demanding better governance and increased accountability the way forward the case for an urban sdg is extremely strong it will mobilize cities and promote the integration of the economic social environmental and governance dimensions of sustainable development such a systems approach to urban development offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities presented by rapid urbanization and avoiding its potential pitfalls a coordinated effort via an urban sdg could transform the lives of vast numbers of urban dwellers across a wide range of countries with very different income levels an urban goal and its targets must be carefully framed to address key issues it must be universally applicable while permitting an adaptable set of indicators to accommodate differing development stages e g rapidly growing small cities and more stable or shrinking large cities in all parts of the world the urban goal must be limited in scope to remain manageable and implementable by and must be mirrored by coordinated regional interventions to address the specific challenges of rural development the sdgs proposed by the sdsn have been designed to respond to these needs the sdsn thematic group on sustainable cities will work with other actors interested in sustainable urban development to promote an urban sdg and to think through the framing and implementation of such a goal based on city and national experiences it is also available to brief interested member states united nations agencies multilateral and bilateral agencies local government associations ngos and other stakeholders on the sustainable development opportunities and challenges in the worlds cities to inform the broader debate on the post development agenda the sdsn is working with a number of cities in major world regions to better understand challenges and to think through solutions in operational detail for questions about the urban sdg work please write to info unsdsn org common questions about an urban sdg why aren t important urban issues like health and education included in the urban sdg proposed by the sdsn though many cities deliver education and health services to their populations the sdsn proposes to address health and education through universal national goals regardless of where a child is born he or she should have access to high quality education likewise universal health delivery requires integration at the national level with the nature and quality of services provided not distinguishing between populations within a country wont an urban sdg promote separation between urban and rural areas some argue that distinct urban and rural goals would draw an artificial separation between urban and rural areas yet sustainable development challenges and governance and institutional arrangements in many countries differ significantly between rural and urban areas hence separating these goals is sound from an analytical institutional and operational perspective experience from countries across all income levels suggests that strong urban rural linkages especially around economic development employment and regional infrastructure and ecosystem services are important to achieving sustainable development outcomes and ending extreme poverty an urban sdg would support these processes and attempt to bridge this limiting dichotomy isnt an urban goal too broad and unmanageable some fear that an urban goal would become too broad and therefore unmanageable in implementation this concern is valid for this reason the sdsn proposes to limit the scope of an urban goal to the issues that require an urban lens and careful integration with other urban challenges major issues like health education food security and decarbonizing the energy system are best managed through dedicated goals that apply to entire countries and can be complemented by the urban institutional arrangements and capacities that are built to deliver an urban sdg what about the fact that there are different definitions of urban a related argument against an urban goal is that the world lacks a universal definition of what constitutes an urban area and that as a result an urban sdg would be ill conceived it is true that definitions for urban and rural areas differ across countries partly for historical and cultural reasons but with increasing urbanization the lower bound of population sizes for cities will tend to converge within the urban sdg framing there is no strict need for countries to adhere to an exact urban definition to implement and measure progress against national and city level targets and indicators enabling transformative and sustainable development the urban opportunity background paper for the co chairs members high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda

seven billion people current urbanization trends indicate that an additional three billion people will be living in cities by increasing the urban share of the worlds population to two thirds cities face major challengesextreme urban poverty poor living conditions for one billion slum dwellers constraints on productivity due to lack of basic infrastructure and risks due to natural disasters and climate change however they also have an extraordinary potential for transformational change due to their concentration of economic activity potential for social transformation high levels of annual investment in infrastructure and buildings high degree of innovation nimble local governments connection to surrounding rural and natural environments ability to reduce eco footprints by densification and suitability for systems based solutions a sustainable development goal sdg on cities could maximize the potential for the dynamics of global urbanization to be directed towards sustainable development solutions for pressing urban problems we propose a post sustainable development goal sdg to empower inclusive productive and resilient cities the draft goal aims to make all cities socially inclusive economically productive environmentally sustainable and resilient to climate change and other risks in addition the goal proposes that cities develop participative accountable and effective city governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation an urban sdg might include the following three targets eliminate extreme urban poverty expand employment and productivity and raise living standards especially in slums and informal settlements ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services housing water sanitation and waste management low carbon energy and transportation and communication ensure safe air quality and water quality for all and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions efficient land and resource use and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards the success of the sdgs will be determined to a large extent in the worlds cities which lie at the fulcrum of employment creation eradication of extreme poverty inclusive economic growth and environmental sustainability the proposed framework of targets and indicators provides a roadmap for operationalizing an urban sdg the framework lays out the tasks needed to build urban capacity to address sustainability goals and the metrics by which to identify success and measure it at the appropriate level of action neighbourhood city region or nation to reduce urban poverty in all its forms end slum formation increase productivity and promote conditions for global sustainability cities will need to ensure universal access to basic urban infrastructure and services housing water sanitation waste management low carbon energy and transportation and information and communication technologies urban areas must invest in strategies to increase resilience to disasters extreme weather events and other threats of climate change transformational technologies such as information and communications technologies can help improve city governance energy and resource use efficiency and delivery of urban services and create new employment opportunities equitable and efficient urban land and resource use is essential as is nurturing urban ecological integrity and its linkages to rural and regional systems to harness the potential of sustainable urbanization city governance will have to be improved in virtually every country metropolitan areas and urban local governments will be at the center of decision making and therefore need to be empowered but they must work with many actors e g national governments local authorities businesses knowledge institutions and civil society together these actors must mobilize the needed financial institutional and human resources across a broad range of urban issues such as jobs housing services and infrastructure this document has been prepared by the sustainable cities thematic group of the sustainable development solutions network sdsn for submission to the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda we gratefully acknowledge the support of the rockefeller foundation in the preparation of this report the findings interpretations and conclusions expressed in this paper are those of the thematic group members alone they do not necessarily represent the views of their affiliated organizations chapter introduction the millennium declaration in and the millennium development goals mdgs successfully focused the worlds attention and action on ending extreme poverty by in the rio summit resolved to finish the job and called for a new set of goals the sustainable development goals sdgs sustainable development was envisioned as a holistic concept addressing four dimensions economic development social inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance the sustainable development solutions network sdsn was launched by the united nations secretary general in to mobilize global scientific and technological knowledge to focus on the challenges of sustainable development the sdsn is organized into thematic groups around key issues such as poverty health education energy and cities the sdsn has proposed ten priority challenges which may form a plausible basis for the sdgs called for at rio in this paper the sdsn thematic group on sustainable cities outlines the historic opportunity currently faced by the global community to transform cities along sustainable development pathways and to leverage the growth investment and social and technological innovation that will occur in cities over the next several decades empowering inclusive productive and resilient cities the sdsn proposes that an sdg to empower inclusive productive and resilient cities be considered this draft goal aims to make all cities socially inclusive economically productive in this paper we use the terms cities and urban areas interchangeably to denote metropolitan areas and all urban centers that have economic or political importance sustainable development solutions network sdsn an action agenda for sustainable development available online at http unsdsn org resources environmentally sustainable and resilient to climate change and other risks in addition the goal proposes that all cities develop participative accountable and effective city governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation the draft goal might include these three targets eliminate extreme urban poverty expand employment and productivity and raise living standards especially in slums and informal settlements ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services housing water sanitation and waste management low carbon energy and transportation and communication ensure safe air quality and water quality for all and integrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions efficient land and resource use and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards these three targets provide a framework for promoting sustainable development in cities although issues such as health education and agriculture are of vital importance to cities and their inhabitants the draft urban sdg does not explicitly address them because they are addressed in other proposed sdgs the targets presented here focus on three critical issues for cities that will not be covered elsewhere each target contains multiple elements analyzed in greater detail below the significant roles played by the crosscutting processes of urban governance financing and urban planning are also examined in order to delineate how progress towards the targets can be measured and evaluated a preliminary set of indicators is proposed cities around the world are highly diverse the needs and priorities of cities in low income countries are different from those in middle or high income countries the challenges and opportunities faced by small and medium sized cities are different from those faced by mega cities with populations of million or more these cities are now deeply interconnected however via the global economic system information trade and financial flows and global environmental challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss despite their diversity there are many common themes that run through cities urban sustainability human rights and the right to the city the proposed urban sdg is based on local national and global targets these targets are based on a set of assertions derived from an established united nations human rights framework the most elaborated right related to sustainable cities is the right to adequate housing which includes several core elements legal security of tenure including protection against forced evictions availability of services including safe drinking water adequate sanitation energy for cooking heating lighting food storage and refuse disposal affordability in that housing costs should not compromise occupants enjoyment of other human rights accessibility taking into account the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups habitability providing physical safety adequate space protection from the elements location in relation to employment opportunities health care schools childcare centers and cultural adequacy cescr another powerful principle that has partially informed the work of this paper is the concept of the right to the city conceived as a demand for a transformed and renewed access to urban life lefebvre it has been described as more than the individual liberty to access urban resources it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city it is moreover a common rather than an individual right since this transformation depends on the exercise of the collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization harvey a number of popular movements including the slum and shack dwellers movement have incorporated the idea into their struggles as a result in brazil passed a federal law premised on the idea of the right to the city that created a new legal urban order to provide land access and equity in large urban cities that has influenced thinking and policymaking around sustainable cities in many parts of the world the urban opportunity the on going transformation to a global urban society offers an unprecedented opportunity to use the urbanization process as a catalyst for sustainable economic and social development well managed cities that are highly connected can use technology effectively to enable greater equity and inclusion can improve societal wellbeing and achieve greater economic growth at lower rates of resource use greenhouse gas emissions and social costs for the first time in human history a majority of the worlds population now lives in urban areas projections indicate that the urban portion of the global population will continue to rise over the next few decades reaching per cent by desa for this reason alone sustainable development efforts must focus strongly on urban areas in addition cities have special characteristics that make them particularly effective as platforms for transformative and sustainable development cities concentrate and can accelerate economic activity the concentration of economic activity in cities contributes significantly to national and global output and employment today cities account for per cent of the worlds gross domestic product gdp mckinsey hence cities are key drivers and participants in a sustainable development transition urban infrastructure investment can enable growth employment and poverty reduction annual urban infrastructure and building investments are expected to rise globally from trillion today to more than trillion by with urban centers in emerging economies attracting the majority of this investment dobbs investment decisions in sustainable long term urban infrastructure can have far reaching impacts on the social and economic welfare of urban dwellers environmental sustainability and climate resilience urban areas are sites of social transformation in many parts of the world urban areas have enabled social transformation and inclusion through processes such as investment in human development addressing asymmetries of gender race age and ethnicity and the participation of citizens in governance local governments are nimble local city governments often have the ability to respond more rapidly to the needs of their populations they can therefore more quickly and flexibly adapt their policies and actions to follow sustainable development pathways cities are sites of innovation cities are the crossroads where diverse cultures meet contest evolve and change they represent and offer rich opportunities for creativity new ideas and synergy between groups the geographic concentration of cities promotes new knowledge generation and the spread of ideas and creativity cities are therefore across countries the urban share of national gdp ranges from an average of per cent in low income developing countries to an average of per cent in high income developed countries in each case urban share of gdp exceeds the urban share of population weiss prime locations for demonstrating emerging technologies as well as innovative social and cultural institutions cities are interconnected with rural areas the development of sustainable urban centers has synergies with surrounding rural areas and communities via economic and employment linkages urban poverty reduction can positively impact rural poverty reduction rural areas help provide the ecosystem services and food security essential to urban functioning and sustainability cities are interconnected with the natural environment sustainability requires that urbanization occur within regional and planetary limits of ecological and other life support systems sustainable development actions taken at the city level can significantly impact the natural environment and health and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental change cities have the potential to minimize our environmental footprint well managed cities that are highly connected and use technology effectively can generate greater levels of societal wellbeing and economic growth at lower rates of resource use and greenhouse gas emissions a dense urban lifestyle can be greener than its rural counterpart especially in high and many middle income countries urban residents drive less and live and work in smaller footprints that require less energy water and materials per person for example the average new yorker is responsible for roughly one third of the green house gas emissions of the average american cities are suited for systems based approaches cities are amongst the most complex and dynamic of human systems sustainable urban development requires a systems based approach to transformation via economies of scale and scope and facilitating rapid social and institutional innovation smart new technologies for managing energy transportation and communications are ideally suited for networked and dense urban environments and have the potential to transform urban areas and their surrounding regions in beneficial and sustainable ways chapter ending extreme urban poverty and raising living standards while cities present a unique opportunity for leadership in global sustainable development they also face multi dimensional challenges that must be addressed in order to realize the full potential of urban transformation one such challenge is ending extreme urban poverty the first target in the proposed sdg for cities is therefore to end extreme urban poverty expand employment and productivity and raise living standards especially in slums urban poverty and slums cities are home to more than half of the worlds population or billion people of these one billion live in slums world bank in many low and middle income countries this urban poverty manifests itself in the formation of slums and informal settlements even in high income countries social exclusion residential segregation and persistent pockets of poverty are common in most cities factors that contribute to the number of urban individuals living in poverty include the million refugees and million persons who were internally displaced over the past two decades unhcr by projections indicate that the global urban population will grow by almost billion to a total of billion desa much of this urban population growth will occur in low and middle income countries especially in asia and africa urban poverty accounts for a growing share of global poverty by estimates indicate that per cent of urban residents will live on less than per day and that over per cent of urban residents will live on less than per day ferre et al in some regions such as latin america eastern europe central asia the middle east and north africa the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in urban areas is already over per cent ferre et al these figures may be even higher if multi dimensional poverty is taken into account as noted above over one billion urban residents today live in such poor quality and overcrowded housing that they can be considered to be slum dwellers slums are often informal settlements that lack provision of basic services and where the inhabitants are at risk of eviction slum dwellers are typically more vulnerable to hunger poverty social exclusion and crime especially women and children in some countries the proportion of the urban population living in such settlements has declined usually as a result of upgrading programs where deficiencies in the provision for basic services were addressed over the last two decades the mdg target of a significant improvement in the lives of at least million slum dwellers by was exceeded despite this achievement the net number of global slum dwellers has grown significantly from million in to about million in un habitat addressing urban poverty over the next few decades urban economic development must be inclusive and contribute to ending extreme urban poverty and improving the lives of slum dwellers most urban hunger is caused by lack of income rather than lack of available food all urban dwellers must have access to sustainable livelihoods and the means to pay for sufficient food for a healthy diet as well as for essential non food needs e g housing water and healthcare for those who earn too little or who are unable to find paid employment social safety nets must be established to address these challenges and as a hedge against inflation that has a disproportionate impact on the poor the multi dimensional poverty index developed by the united nations development programme uses three dimensions of poverty health education living standards with ten corresponding indicators child mortality nutrition years of school children enrolled cooking fuel toilet water electricity floor assets this definition reveals different patterns than income poverty source undp short term solutions to increasing income in some middle income countries might include conditional cash transfers such as the bolsa familia in brazil fenwick the effectiveness of such schemes depends on having adequate institutional capacity to ensure that the transfers are accessible that they are actually delivered and that they are sufficient to ensure that both food and non food needs are met longer term solutions include the shared measures that many low income groups also take to avoid impoverishment and hunger for example groups may set up savings accounts or build small asset bases that can be drawn on as needed the scope and coverage of these support mechanisms should be enhanced integrating and improving slums three interventions could help improve spatially concentrated urban poverty within cities the first type of intervention includes granting security of land tenure enabling the functioning of land markets and integrating slum improvement into national state and local urban development plans and processes second public and private financing can be targeted to extend basic servicespublic and quasi public goods like water supply sanitation electricity transport and connectivityinto these low income settlements third citizen engagement can enable accountability and better governance improving nutrition via urban agriculture in cities where access to food is inadequate unreliable or irregular or where residents lack adequate purchasing power urban agriculture can serve to reduce poverty and hunger in addition local urban agriculture can reduce the cost of food by eliminating the expense of supplying and distributing food from rural areas these activities can expand access to fresh and nutritious food and create opportunities for urban jobs growing plants and raising animals within cities and in peri urban areas is rapidly growing in importance rooftops and building walls are increasingly being used for intensive agriculture taking advantage of sunlight rainfall capture and nutrient recycling from city waste currently approximately to per cent of the worlds food is produced in urban areas armar klemesu strategies that cities can use to support urban agriculture include farm to market infrastructure safe and sufficient water distribution services and seed banks improving health cities can be associated with good health with many cities in high and middle income countries having high life expectancies at birth and very low infant child and maternal mortality rates but there are also many cities that perform poorly with infant child and maternal mortality rates or more times higher than in healthy cities a good health care system can contribute much to ending poverty improved health care can reduce income lost to ill health and injury and reduce mortality monitoring of key health determinants is important although data on many aspects of urban health especially morbidity and injuries are difficult to separate from national statistics it is also difficult to get data on measures of wellbeing such as mental health and psycho social stressors urban epidemiological profiles differ significantly from rural populations and introduce new risks for urban health systems to address especially the simultaneous growth of communicable and non communicable disease universal access to good quality healthcare facilities and emergency services is critical potential indicators percentage of urban population with incomes below national level established poverty line metrics both extreme and non extreme per cent of total proportion of population living in slums and informal settlements per cent of total malnutrition or stunting prevalence in children under years old per cent of total inclusive economic development the process of urbanization is linked to a geographic concentration of economic activity and investment an increase in the proportion of industrial and service sector employment rising productivity and often increased employment and economic development this economic activity can be a driver for sustainable development but only if means are found to ensure that the urban poor benefit local economic development has been used in many cities as a successful strategy to address uneven development and extreme poverty pro poor and inclusive local economic policies can enable city governments to address poverty unemployment social deprivation and vulnerability by promoting youth employment empowering marginalized communities and promoting gender equity note that the per day per capita poverty line and its adjustment to a day is not an appropriate indicator of urban poverty it does not adequately allow for the non food needs that must be paid for in cities such as accommodation water etc informal economies although statistics on the informal economy are unreliable estimates indicate that the informal sector makes up between and percent of non agricultural employment in north africa latin america and sub saharan africa estimates for high income countries are around percent ilo informal economies are diverse and can include a wide variety of activities such as domestic workers garment workers street vendors crafts people garbage recyclers and waste pickers they can include domestic manufacturing household and small scale enterprises and larger enterprises such as para transit systems carr and chen the relationship between the informal sector and poverty is complex on the one hand significant income and gender inequalities exist average incomes in the informal sector are substantially lower than in the formal sector with little or no social security and high occupational health and safety risks furthermore in many parts of the world a majority of informal sector workers are women on the other hand these conditions are contrasted with the observation that labor productivity in some informal occupations can be higher than that of formal occupations to ensure that economic development benefits the poor a greater recognition of the importance of the informal economy is needed as well as less harassment of those in informal employment such as waste pickers and street vendors city government must recognize the importance of the informal economy and the informal settlements that house much of the labor force that the citys prosperity depends on ways to address the challenges of the informal sector include establishing a system of urban entitlements establishing an urban social safety net and formalizing informal jobs through state regulation initiatives that have been helpful in promoting greater income and employment equity within the informal sector and with the more formal economic sectors of society include securing identities enabling land rights and providing financial access and inclusion for example via microcredit potential indicators share of urban informal sector of national gdp per cent of total annual urban net employment creation rate by sector formal informal gender age per cent ratio of urban unemployment to national unemployment rate ratio urban workforce participation rate by gender and age per cent of total urban gender wage disparity index ratio share of urban informal sector workers with access to social protection and security per cent of total urban mean annual growth in value added per worker per cent chapter universal access to basic urban services and housing the second target in the proposed sdg on cities is to provide universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services housing water sanitation and waste management low carbon energy and transport and communication access to basic infrastructure services as noted above annual investments in urban buildings and infrastructure are expected to increase from the present trillion to trillion in the coming decades dobbs providing an important opportunity to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development through investment cities offer economies of scale and scope for both economic activity and the provision of basic infrastructure services water sanitation and waste management energy transportation and communications investment in these services provides additional multiplier benefits to city regional and national economies the sound management of urban services is therefore central to cities capacity to enable prosperity providing basic servicessafe sufficient and affordable water safe and accessible sanitation and ecologically efficient waste management and energy access for allis fundamental to the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers and a necessary condition for economic development innovation and prosperity the most dramatic reduction in the burden of disease and child mortality has been enabled by improvements in these services lack of functioning infrastructure and inequitable provision of basic urban services contributes to social instability in cities access to water supply estimates indicate that individuals need to liters of water per day to ensure that basic needs are met for drinking cooking and cleaning wwap access to water continues to be a problem in many low and middle income countries today with over million people lacking access to improved sources of drinking water who and unicef access to sanitation and waste management services adequate sanitation services including safe disposal of human waste garbage collection and wastewater disposal are essential for ensuring the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease and improvements in sanitation have been shown to have significant beneficial health impacts both in households and across communities in an estimated billion people worldwide lacked access to basic sanitation services who and unicef although limited data is available on the urban population it is estimated that in at least million lacked adequate sanitation un habitat most cities and smaller urban centres in sub saharan africa and many in asia have no sewers and in the ones that do this reaches a fraction of their population fewer than per cent of cities in low and middle income countries have their wastewater treated mara key challenges to effective waste management include integrating the informal waste sector in developing cities and reducing generation and consumption in developed cities particularly in high income countries cities must strive to reduce waste contributions to landfills by implementing recycling and composting programs consistent with a goal of generating close to zero waste access to energy services universal access to affordable efficient and low carbon energy services is essential for inclusive economic development for some parts of the world such as urban south asia and sub saharan africa access to energy is a key challenge about billion people in the world do not have access to electricity and this number could grow as the population increases iea among urban populations million lacked access to clean fuels in with million lacking electricity mitlin and satterthwaite energy access for all can be promoted by providing cost effective reliable and available low carbon generation transmission and distribution of energy providing energy efficient centralized and decentralized systems appropriate for housing enterprises lifeline and social infrastructure strengthening market and regulatory mechanisms to enable realistic pricing of energy and carbon emissions with targeted support for poor households and small enterprises in other parts of the world the key challenge is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing overall energy use increasing energy efficiency and increasing use of renewable energy current market and regulatory conditions are not sufficient to drive the global development and deployment of low carbon technology to the extent necessary for the challenge to be met zero waste is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused any trash sent to landfills and incinerators is minimal see for example http zerowasteinstitute org success will require a stronger collaboration between stakeholders and urgent action by governments in particular increasing energy efficiency using an appropriate nationally determined fuel mix that enables energy security with agreed upon environmental safeguards and continuous performance improvements modifying urban structure resource flows mobility systems and building performance to dramatically reduce energy intensity and carbon emissions deploying large scale energy efficiency conservation smart grid and low carbon energy systems and technologies at scale through partnerships and pooled research and development for emerging clean energy technologies access to mobility services mobility is critical to successful urbanization as well as social and economic development it connects people to jobs markets essential services and political representation it enables businesses to contribute to development by serving new markets and unlocking new resources access to mobility is unequal both between high income and low income countries and within countries and cities the poor make fewer trips and spend a greater proportion of their time and income getting to where they want to go wbcsd urban mobility challenges must be addressed to enable inclusive economic development and job creation in cities and mitigate rapidly growing traffic congestion air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions cities should prioritize access to affordable low carbon mobility solutions such as public transportation safe active mobility solutions such as walking and biking and innovative mobility solutions such as shared purpose built lightweight and or electric vehicles sound land use planning integrated with transportation planning can provide the affordable access appropriate densities mix of land uses and safety for vulnerable populations that make these low carbon transportation solutions feasible information and communications technology urban dwellers live in an increasingly networked and globally interconnected world where ict can play a crucial role in achieving urban sustainable development these technologies enable participation a freer flow of information and knowledge and greater opportunity to encounter diversity they provide opportunities for creating new enterprises and expanding existing ones developing and disseminating educational programs and stimulating cultural activities icts can be used to efficiently and effectively manage finite resources in an urbanizing world with the potential to reduce water consumption provide more efficient electricity distribution and reduce pollution levels and congestion through better traffic management in addition they can bring services such as health education shopping and work into the home itu to realize these potential benefits applications must work together and interoperate regardless of service provider or vendor achieving this will require the development of international standards harmonized frequency spectrum and the application of enabling policies and best practices itu potential indicators share of urban households with access to safe sufficient drinking water per cent of total share of urban households served by safe sanitation services per cent of total share of urban households provided with waste collection and management services including recycling and composting services per cent of total proportion of solid waste diverted from landfills to meet zero waste goal per cent of total share of urban households and businesses with access to affordable and reliable low carbon energy per cent of total share of urban households with access to cell phones and high speed internet connections number per inhabitants affordable housing for all to end extreme urban poverty provide basic services and raise living standards cities must provide access to housing that is safe affordable and of adequate quality in cities housing becomes unaffordable not just as a consequence of poverty but also as a consequence of families needing to spend a large portion of their income on other basic needs such as food water clothing healthcare and education higher levels of food insecurity are typically associated with an increased share of income spent on housing upgrading slums slums by definition consist of low quality housing with inadequate access to basic services un habitat sustainable urban development must focus on raising the living standards of slum dwellers slum upgrading is a well established strategy that can benefit all residents rather than select beneficiaries and can effectively induce investments using incentives such as tenure security housing formalization infrastructure improvement and livelihood creation imposing formal building standards in slum areas as a strategy to promote upgrading has often been definition of affordable includes the percentage of household income spent on energy accessibility includes not just availability but also ability to purchase and reliability counterproductive and resulted in a lack of access to shelter for the urban poor urban slums in inner cities are often located on lands that have become increasingly valuable and contested forced evictions then may occur although they are contrary to the norms of international law and well established practices of in situ local economic development and upgrading cohre forced evictions need to be addressed via enabling law and policy mechanisms for ensuring affordable housing slums and informal settlements are not a stand alone phenomenon they are linked to urban planning and development practices most cities across low middle or high income countries face challenges in providing affordable housing and universal service coverage especially during periods of rapid growth or decline city housing policies and strategies sometimes fail to match supply with demand resulting in large numbers of vacant housing units and inadequate supply of affordable ownership and rental housing slum upgrading is most successful as part of a longer term framework of urban and housing policies underpinned by appropriate planning sustainable housing development strategies recognize the need to integrate housing with mixed urban land uses at appropriate densities improve mobility provide access to employment and integrate social groups to enable inclusion given stratification of incomes a diversity of tenure types including ownership cooperatives shared leaseholds and various forms of renting and condominiums are effective in enabling universal access to housing in most cities adequate security of tenure is an important guarantee of the welfare of households and a stimulus to improvements and expansion a variety of housing finance options should be explored and made available including mortgage finance financing for social and rental housing non collateral credit mechanisms for owner builders credit for developers contractors and producers of building materials and components cross subsidy mechanisms within urban projects between commercial and housing land uses and between high cost and low cost housing are important to encourage socially mixed development potential indicators proportion of urban population living in slums and informal settlements per cent to total proportion of urban

reductions in greenhouse gas emissions efficient land and resource use and climate and disaster resilience into investments and standards access to clean water and air in cities water and air pollution are among the most severe and chronic challenges faced by low and middle income cities whose environmental infrastructure and regulatory capacity are significantly impacted by rapid growth inadequate ability to invest in advance of new development and large areas of informal settlements with poor or non existent services inadequate water quality and indoor and outdoor air quality leads to millions of premature deaths each year especially among children and others who are health compromised murray et al environmental health improvements in high income countries resulted from the transformation of universal drinking water standards and increased access to municipal water sanitation and drainage services this transformation should be extended to all cities taking into account environmental and resource constraints to support the process of poverty reduction and slum upgrading air pollution has been successfully reduced through a combination of interventions shifting to clean manufacturing techniques creating incentives for compact urban development inner city renewal and appropriate planning regulations transitioning to public and active transport clean household and transportation fuels and more energy efficient vehicles strengthening ict access to reduce commuting creating disincentives to unsustainable transportation and strong regulation of highly polluting enterprises a package of these interventions will need to be customised to the requirements of individual cities given their diversity of incomes fuel sources spatial structures mix of transport modes and institutional capacities climate change and cities climate change is the predominant st century global environmental threat urban areas contribute up to per cent of greenhouse gas emissions primarily because of the concentration of industrial production and construction within urban centers iea a transition by from fossil fuel dominated urban energy systems through low carbon to renewable energy systems for cities across the world is one of the most important factors that could halt the onset of climate change the speed and form of this transition will strongly determine the economic environmental and social disruption that climate variability and change can cause a range of strategies and instruments will be required to address the diversity of urban systems and their metabolisms across the world increased urban vulnerability to climate change the continued accelerated growth in greenhouse gas ghg emissions is projected to significantly impact urban communities and major urban sectors including food water transportation and energy systems and public health a four fold increase and rise in intensity of urban natural disasters since illustrates how cities and their inhabitants have become more exposed and vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events unisdr the further onset of climate change is projected to exacerbate these trends cities are expected to experience these impacts in the form of enhanced variability and changing frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heat waves intense droughts and riverine and street level floods that can compromise water supplies and human health for coastal cities impacts can include enhanced sea level rise and storm surges that will affect inhabitants as well as essential critical infrastructure and ecosystems disaster risk reduction climate adaptation and resiliency the challenge of climate change highlights the need for cities to rethink how assets are deployed and people protected how infrastructure investments are prioritized and how climate mitigation and adaptation is integrated into long term growth and development plans climate mitigation adaptation and resilience planning and disaster risk reduction are frequently discussed as separate processes rather than together a new resilience paradigm is emerging for cities on how they can continue to develop while developing and integrating climate mitigation and adaptation plans in most cities across the world data is increasingly available to determine current and future climate hazards emissions inventories vulnerability of populations buildings and lifeline infrastructure and community and institutional capacity that can serve as a foundation to build local resilience new urbanisation investment and harnessing synergies guiding new urbanization and redevelopment in existing cities needs to be consistent with enhanced climate resiliency and integrating climate concerns into investment decisions this is a key transformative opportunity to move toward a more sustainable development pathway while cities continue to grapple with traditional issues around access to urban infrastructure and services they are forced to provide that access at ever greater speeds sometimes resulting in the failure to consider and plan for risks posed by disasters and climate change making infrastructure investments through the lens of climate change can pose challenges since immediate needs can sometimes supercede long term and more globally oriented responses emphasizing the co benefits of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies can help build support for these policies for example infrastructure to promote safe walking and cycling in addition to reducing ghgs from transportation and increasing resilience can improve air quality and ameliorate public health harnessing such synergies will be a key to success potential indicators proportion of cities regions with

if urban social and economic systems recognize that they are dependent on healthy ecological systems sustainability requires that urbanization occur within regional and planetary limits of ecological and other life support systems a central element of urban environmental sustainability is the opportunity to strengthen urban biodiversity and the level of ecosystem services provided an urbanizing world needs specific goals for cities that ensure ecosystem integrity and the conservation of major ecosystem services rethinking urban ecological services to cities traditional approaches to urban services do not include the vital role of ecosystem services a rethinking of traditional approaches to urban services is now needed as well as the development of new tools such as valuation and restoration of ecosystem services for example the health of urban ecosystems depends on access to clean water and adequate soil properties and nutrients poorly designed or functioning city drainage can lead to soil and water contamination flash floods and ensuing damage to ecosystems and humans watershed restoration and protection should be a key objective of reconnecting hydrological processes into urban design this includes ensuring access to and conservation of scarce water resources especially in ecologically stressed regions of the world managing a continuous influx of people and infrastructure in cities creates pressures on supporting ecosystems both within cities and in their surrounding regions these pressures vary depending on city size structure and spatial organization as well as on the vulnerability of each specific type of ecosystem degradation and fragmentation of urban ecosystems is an important challenge for all cities these can be addressed by embracing ecological strategies that will enable the provision of safe water and air for all and conservation of biodiversity as well as a broad range of other ecosystem services for cities and their residents soil quality in cities is impacted by contamination fragmentation fertilization and irrigation but can be improved through soil and water management and composting of waste these in turn will provide health and economic benefits successful new approaches to link isolated land parcels into continuous corridors and networks are now being tested tree cover in cities makes up a significant proportion of national forestry in many countries supports rich biodiversity cools streets reduces noise and dust and slows water run off there is also a significant potential for carbon sequestration in cities through restoration and management of urban ecosystems green corridors are increasingly being established across urban areas to connect rural and wild land with the city for the benefit of both residents and urban biota these corridors can include lake catchments for water storage recreation areas forests and green streets for walking and cycling an important benefit of restoring and retaining ecological systems is to enable the active and inclusive connection of humans to nature the benefits of which can lead to improved human health and broader understanding of the need to protect local regional national and global ecosystems temperature differences between urban and surrounding non urban areas occur due to lack of vegetation and darker materials these differences tend to more prevalent at night and can lead to increases in cooling energy loads and human health effects associated with physiological heat stress earth observation satellite thermal imaging can be used to measure this and correlate with measurements of urban vegetation abundance measured by normal difference vegetation index nvdi increased areas of green space and tree planting can have a

an essential enabling condition for achieving the three targets of the urban sdg is the development of effective city governance and financing systems that deepen participation accountability and the rule of law in addition urban planning presents a powerful tool for implementing effective governance and bringing about sustainable change via effective land use effective city governance cities are emerging as an important new level of governance across the world rapid urbanization and urban sprawl have led to the emergence of large metropolitan regions for which a new type of governance model is required the urban political system in many regions is widening its focus from government to governance decentralization and democratization in response to the growing complexity of governing in a globalizing multi level context and the need to engage a range of private sector and non state actors deepening local institutional capacities in all countries local authorities and urban governments are challenged by the limited human institutional and financial resources at their disposal in most countries local authorities are still learning how to effectively engage with citizens and interest groups around an increasingly complex agenda of change innovations like participatory budgeting help link municipal investments to local priorities enable social sector funding service provision and financial human and material resource flows to poorer areas of cities first developed in brazil in the late s and now extended to over urban centers across the world deepening participation and improving pro poor management the physical proximity between the elites the vulnerable and the deprived is a stark contradiction of most st century cities in a youthful world bursting with aspiration of a better future media and information access has brought exclusion to the forefront of the public imagination to address this city governments have a key role in using urban planning management and local economic development interventions to limit urban stratification exclusion and gentrification by promoting equitable access to employment and socially diverse neighborhoods participative local governance helps deepen democratic participation civic dialogue and facilitating outcomes that enrich the quality of life of all citizens diversity of cultures in the form of heritage and knowledge is a vital part of cities integral to their identity and dynamism as hubs of social and human development culture provides identity agency and tools for communities to fight poverty integrating diversity of culture into governance based on the needs and expectations of citizens facilitates participation intercultural dialogue and the practice of equality of rights a new voice for movements of the urban poor governance in cities can be strongly influenced by mobilisation of groups of the urban poor especially if they are able to work with local governments inclusive participatory processes with a focus on slum upgrading and service provision for marginalized citizens have been effective in many regions in promoting economic development and reducing urban poverty many of the social reforms that have transformed the living conditions and health of low income population cities in what are today high income nations were responses to the demands of organized groups of the urban poor organizations and federations of slum and shack dwellers self employed women and waste pickers have become increasingly important in giving voice to the rights needs and demands of the poor a more inclusive city with strong local government private sector and civil society alliances provides the opportunity to change behavior and patterns of consumption production and social relations over the last few decades many communities have been unwilling to passively accept the planning decisions of politicians and technocrats that impact on their day to day environments participation by citizens groups movements community based and non governmental organizations and the important role of micro to transnational enterprises are changing the landscape of engagement and change in cities and city regions deepening multi scale economic social and cultural networks cities are increasingly connected to each other economically and via social and cultural ties that link together neighbourhoods and communities around concerns such as livelihood security mobility and water and air quality megacities and mega urban regions will typically concentrate large proportions of the economic environmental and human resources of their countriesrequiring fundamentally new modes of governance technological and environmental management systems to enable their sustainability effective governance is essential to ensure that the concentrations of people infrastructure and enterprises work towards sustainability rather than mal development innovative financing appropriate fiscal and financial instruments such as participatory budgeting can provide the investment needed for greater urban sustainability at neighbourhood city and regional scales the effectiveness of new strategies is dependent on the level of transparency of governance structures and supported by clear evidence metrics intergovernmental financing systems can be restructured to enable greater capacity at local levels within cities e g neighbourhood level and in turn provide opportunities for greater accountability and innovation these new financial arrangements can bring together local interests private enterprises and domestic international and multilateral investors with a special interest in long term environmental equity and inclusion concerns it is of course recognized that public resources have become increasingly strained in both developing and developed country contexts and that significant funding progress is in many cases increasingly dependent on private financing a city region investment fund strategy could be set up to support agreed upon regional objectives combined with innovative new asset classes of green growth funding climate adaptation funding and social enterprise bonds the advantage of such a strategy and potential portfolio approach depending on availability of funding is that climate adaptation can de risk green growth infrastructure assets and social investment bonds can support skills training to underpin local job creation from green growth investment leveraging investment finance and integrated planning building on traditional public finance flows at city and regional levels investment finance can be drawn down into projects that promote urban goals via a variety of institutional structures such as public private partnerships to deliver a variety of social environmental and economic outcomes the use of integrated planning tools to support this could enable greater impacts to be achieved in terms of resource efficiency and socially beneficial outcomes potential indicators value of urban revenues numbers value of market transfers numbers value of market borrowing including foreign direct investment per cent of gdp urban planning for more effective land markets urban planning can be an effective mechanism to improve the lives of the urban poor and to improve the quality and sustainability of urban life in high income countries in recent decades there have been serious limitations in the planning design and management of urban land markets mobility systems and land use planning in many low and middle income countries this has lead to a range of inadequate outcomes including rapid un served peri urban growth growth of large slum areas and informal settlements close to employment opportunities and hyper dense and poorly serviced living and working conditions for millions of people these impacts can be compounded in large metropolitan regions and urban corridors that are resource inefficient segregated less inclusive and economically less competitive expanding global urban sprawl between and the footprint of urbanized areas across the world grew on average at three times the rate of population growth resulting in an effective worldwide reduction in density in urban areas angel et al these two decades of urban expansion in most high income and a few middle income countries have been focused on single use and automobile oriented development patterns this trend has reduced the opportunity for achieving minimum densities for efficient and affordable public transportation and walkable neighbourhoods both hallmarks of efficient inclusive resilient and accessible cities and regions rapid urban expansion also has been documented in many developing country settings as well impact of expanding sprawl and suburbanisation especially in high income countries urban sprawl brings a well documented host of challenges including long commutes traffic congestion high vehicle miles travelled greenhouse gas emissions loss of farmland isolated communities loss of walkability public health concerns around sedentary living and often a high household water footprint per capita in high and middle income countries new suburban communities are often geared towards higher income residents with a housing market that has traditionally failed to provide sufficient integrated affordable housing in some low and middle income countries sprawl has been associated with increased metropolitan fragmentation and the peripheralisation of poverty and informal settlements at the same time in many lower and middle income countries redevelopment of inner city areas has led to forced evictions of poor households out of inner city areas to more distant sites that require longer commutes and that have reduced access to public services promoting walkable and efficient cities in order to achieve economic social and environmental sustainability cities and regions need to re embrace compact walkable and mixed use neighborhoods this requires a shift away from the mono functional city of low density and long distances which is poorly connected socially divided and economically inefficient new communities can be planned and existing communities can be retrofitted to provide greater access to public transportation job centers and other daily amenities advantages include reducing travel distances reducing travel costs reducing transportation energy use and emissions reducing service delivery costs saving valuable resources and farmland optimizing land use promoting social diversity and improving public health by providing everyday opportunities for walking and cycling the creation of walkable communities must be accompanied by the provision of accessible and enjoyable public open spaces as well as the creation of low carbon public transportation smart land use planning zoning and building codes should promote such mixed use higher density mixed income communities reasserting the importance of urban public space reasserting the importance of urban public space is an effective entry point for improving a citys functioning the ways in which space is deployed and shaped proximity and

significant challenges to governments private enterprises civil society and communities collective action by and across these institutional groups can ensure a convergence of entitlements and public policy enterprise and collective action to support this multi dimensional transition to an urban world without significant economic social or environmental disruption the proposed urban sdg focused on empowering inclusive productive and resilient cities provides a forward looking framework to achieve sustainability for all citizens cities countries and the planet while urban challenges appear daunting there is a great opportunity for cities to play a leading if not decisive role in enabling the local national and global transformation to sustainable development urban sustainable development is complex involving not only many sectors but also many political entities an urban sdg is therefore an important mechanism to mobilize and bring together the efforts of multiple actors and stakeholders across a range of urban issues and mobilize the financial institutional and human resources to make this possible the proposed framework of targets and indicators provides a roadmap for the actions needed to operationalize an urban sdg the framework lays out the broad tasks needed to build the urban capacity to address sustainability goals and the metrics by which success can be first identified and measured at the appropriate level of devolution neighbourhood city region or nation to reduce urban poverty in all its forms end slum formation increase productivity and promote conditions for global sustainability cities will need to ensure universal access to basic urban infrastructure and services housing water sanitation waste management low carbon energy and transportation and information and communication technologies urban areas must invest in strategies to increase resilience to disasters extreme weather events and other threats of climate change transformational technologies such as information and communications technologies can help improve city governance energy and resource use efficiency and delivery of urban services and create new employment opportunities equitable and efficient urban land and resource use is essential as is nurturing urban ecological integrity and its linkages to rural and regional systems to harness the potential of sustainable urbanization city governance will have to be improved in virtually every country metropolitan areas and urban local governments will be at the center of decision making and therefore need to be empowered but they must work with many actors e g national governments local authorities businesses knowledge institutions and civil society together these actors must mobilize the needed financial institutional and human resources across a broad range of urban issues such as jobs housing services and infrastructure the success of the sdgs will be determined heavily in the

implications for and beyond background paper for the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda prepared by professor joshua castellino dean middlesex university professor of law and co chair of the sustainable development solutions network thematic group on the challenges of social inclusion gender inequalities and human rights january creating a world where the equal worth of every individual is respected and valued is simple to articulate but difficult to deliver the universal declaration of human rights was a powerful statement of intent and in the intervening years attempts were made in every jurisdiction to create legislative administrative and judicial mechanisms to ensure these values were upheld at the international level this resulted in exponential growth of human rights law judged against three indicators a proliferation of human rights legal standards b emphases placed on human rights within state practice and c take up of human rights norms by international institutions human rights mechanisms tend to focus primarily on civil and political rights instead of the full spectrum of human rights including socio economic and cultural rights as a result these mechanisms have been relatively ineffective in addressing issues of social inclusion empowering communities in socio economic terms or making contributions to ending poverty the mechanisms have not had solutions for those in the bottom billion nor have cogent legal systems been implemented for inter generational rights enabling focus on the environment and challenges raised by planetary boundaries viewed from the lens that planetary boundaries may create competition over scarce resources it is likely that these mechanisms will be unable to stop the furthering of inequality caused by such competition a further central element that needs to be borne in mind is that human rights mechanisms have traditionally been antagonistic to states focusing on naming and shaming them for what is deemed poor performance rather than working collaboratively with then towards finding and implementing effective solutions a long term perspective to and beyond needs to address some of the following trends which are likely to impact gender equality social inclusion and human rights ongoing environmental degradation will have a strong impact on the poor and marginalized populations since they tend to i depend the most on natural resources for their livelihoods ii live in areas that are particularly prone to environmental degradation and iii are least able to protect themselves against the effect of environmental degradation conflict over scarce resources will become more common as population pressure local environmental degradation and global environmental change in particular climate change combine to put pressure on vulnerable communities the resulting fragility is particularly evident in the drylands where pastoralist communities often compete with sedentary farmers over scarce water resources and grazing grounds population growth and fertility rates tend to be highest in poor countries and among poor people particularly in rural areas having large numbers of children early in life increases maternal mortality disempowers women lowers per capita investments in children and therefore increases child mortality rates and poor education outcomes human migratory flows will likely grow in volume and become more dispersed with growing numbers of people seeking refuge in todays emerging countries such flows create misery for many migrants put pressure on weaker populations in host see the framework for sustainable development prepared by the leadership council of the sdsn for a fuller discussion of some of these trends countries and deprive the migrant countries of dynamic and relatively well educated people brain drain the growing importance of the private sector will challenge traditional models of state led human rights instruments as governments will need to negotiate policies with business civil society and other stakeholders technological change offers new opportunities for delivering social services and income opportunities for the poor but it also changes the nature of jobs increases the skill premium and promotes the winner takes all effect as a result inequalities within countries are likely to rise unless counteracted by active policies unprecedented urban growth puts pressure on traditional communities and their organization the main concerns the framework of human rights has not adequately addressed the issues raised above while nonetheless being successful the main reasons for this failure concern the nature of the framework its contents and how it has been applied thus the framework itself consists of un charter and treaty based bodies which operate in standard setting implementation and monitoring the vast majority of the last six decades have focused on standard setting with implementation left to a state party and monitoring usually taking the form of naming and shaming assisted by increasingly vocal civil society voices rather than assisting solutions however these interactions have all too often been framed as confrontations resulting in defensive postures and a failure to focus on implementable solutions the over emphasis on civil and political rights has skewed content away from the kinds of issues that are of central concern in terms of social inclusion this has narrowed the human rights remit and restricted accurate diagnoses of human rights within states for instance while organizations such as freedom house can provide relatively accurate pictures of the issue of freedom of speech through its index this is not necessarily an indicator of the likely pressures within a society finally the processes of human rights have placed overt emphasis on the international level while it is clear that major innovations and social policy solutions are more likely to emanate at national level the cumulative result of these factors mean that human rights mechanisms and frameworks have had little impact on the trends highlighted above a failure to correct the trajectory of human rights law to make it focus on the needs and challenges faced by vulnerable communities including women would mean that inequalities would persist into the future and issues concerning the environment would be de linked from the human security dimension of the human condition business as usual risks exacerbating the following shortcomings of the prevailing approach to human rights a excessive reliance on civil political rights while ignoring issues concerning socio economic rights as occurring in a marketized sphere where women and minorities due to structural inequalities are less likely to be able to compete as equals b over reliance on advocacy as a tool to gain rights with the result that excluded communities are likely to remain further away from social policy makers and only gain their rights through expensive processes c overt focus on individual rather than collective rights derived from western origin laissez faire governance models while issues confronting social exclusion need collective solutions d an overt reliance of generating remedies through parliamentary processes is ineffective in terms of vulnerable communities whose access to such mechanisms is limited by their relatively poor rate of political participation e using human rights as a naming and shaming tool with uncertain political support from many countries alienates them f the articulation of a human rights based approach which means different things in different contexts perpetrates confusion g over emphasis on states as the primary liable actors for rights violations pathways towards sustainable development stripped to basic principles the human rights agenda to and beyond ought to be focused on guaranteeing fundamental equalities and not non discrimination non discrimination requires that systems treat everyone the same only valid when each individual or community starts from the same premise of equal access to opportunities treating unequals as equals perpetrates new inequalities undermining the human rights project in terms of any potential framing of goals this requires that extra attention is paid specifically to the attainment of targets among vulnerable communities defined i in terms of ethnicity religion and or language with further attention to women within these communities and ii to women as a category across all indicators many developing countries have worked on unpicking persistent inequalities undermining their existence for example china has sought to create administrative mechanisms to enable the ascent from poverty of communities in millions this has been achieved through a series of affirmative actions and policy changes in education political governance and linguistic rights indias affirmative action measures stem from basic constitutional guarantees of equality and have challenged culturally ingrained inequalities that form the caste system through administrative processes new zealand has worked to create processes undoing historical violations placing the maori in a subjugated position to the parekha settlers and instituting remedies that challenge inequalities lebanon has attempted to create administrative processes to calibrate christian and muslim influences through consociationalism a form of power sharing while underscoring the need for such divisions to disappear over time even iraq emerging from the shadow of oppression and subsequent occupation has sought to create mechanisms to accommodate kurdish ambitions numerous african states such as uganda and kenya are engaged in discussions concerning the efficacy of land tenure systems and the south africans have demonstrated that socio economic rights can be made justiciable through access to anti retroviral drugs colombia has led the way on recognizing indigenous rights with echoes in mexico and bolivia while brazil has sought mechanisms to put the bolsa familia scheme on a firm legal footing these measures each with inherent faults nonetheless represent a departure from time honed approaches to human rights involving advocates locked in battle with governments the un human rights councils universal periodic review has demonstrated that naming and shaming is not the only human rights tool available instead the pooling of genuine administrative experiences in various contexts is much more likely to yield results two proposals with this in mind the high level panel is urged to ensure that the language of human rights articulated specifically in terms of equality of opportunity and the removal of inequality features strongly in the post framework that the post framework emphasize the importance of deriving and developing the use of comparative administrative legal frameworks conducive to combatting inequality emphasize the need for active collaboration and not antagonism between human rights mechanisms governments civil society and business urge the un human rights council to be ever more mindful of the indivisibility of human rights and to pay particular heed to how they impact the development agenda post the sdsn thematic group on challenges of social inclusion gender inequalities and human rights will explore how it might launch two important initiatives one to serve as an accurate diagnostic tool and the other to focus on the generation of solutions to intractable human rights issues a develop the measurement of human rights capacities in a manner conducive to problem solving rather than naming and shaming with particular attention to the socio economic needs of communities as well as the rate of access to these among vulnerable groups b create and maintain a database of existing administrative mechanisms such as the ones identified above and to develop these and others as models that could be applied in conjunction with the range of other solutions being proposed with a above human rights metrics have been negligent in creating accurate diagnostic tools as a result human rights criticism is all too often rhetorical and single dimensional the idea is to develop a human rights index to create a diagnostic tool enabling adequate comparison of human rights within states while catering for other competing imperatives such as the opportunity cost of investing in health or other welfare such an index would show how technical support and policy change could have significant impact on human rights gender parity and social inclusion within each country with b above the vast majority of legal models perpetrated throughout the world have derived from the limited experiences of countries such as the united states of america the united kingdom canada france germany and to a lesser extent italy and japan these models are unsuited to many developing countries the proposed initiative will make available the models and lessons from a much broader range of countries the two processes in tandem will enable genuine assessment of performance identification of areas of concern and reliance on social policy models that may be appropriate drawn from other contexts we would welcome to partner with any members of the high level panel who are interested in contributing to either of these initiatives conclusion in short the to tackle the and agendas the hpls report ought to emphasize the following points a social inclusion is fundamental to the post development strategy b states civil society international organizations and the private sector need a collaborative not antagonistic approach in seeking active solutions to social exclusion c the indivisibility of human rights is fundamental to progress with greater emphasis required on socio economic rights within the framework d the need for the generation of appropriate legal frameworks to the multi faceted solutions proposed post e the importance of deriving solutions drawn from state practice around the world especially in the economic south f the need for the creation of appropriate diagnostic tools to understand rather than criticize competing priorities for state intervention and follow these up with appropriate models that may be useful starting points in endorsing this approach the high level panel could make a significant contribution in highlighting that human rights is not a what but who question in other words legal mechanisms need to address human security aspects of all especially the vulnerable and focus only on problems faced by failures to gain civil and political rights compliance womens role in economic development overcoming the constraints high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda background paper for the prepared by dr sarah bradshaw principal lecturer middlesex university with dr joshua castellino and ms bineta diop co chairs of the sustainable development solutions network thematic group on the challenges of social inclusion gender inequalities and human rights may introduction this short paper aims to highlight the important role women have and can play in economic development it addresses three questions what is the evidence base to support investing in women what are the current constraints on realising the full potential of women in the process of economic development what are the priority areas of intervention necessary to unblock these constraints it is focussed on women and on economic development rather than on the wider issue of gender and development however before looking at the evidence base constraints and interventions it will provide a brief context of the evolution of thinking around women and development the evolution of women in development to gender and development in the s research on african farmers noted that far from being gender neutral development was gender blind and could harm women out of this realization emerged the women in development wid approach which constructed the problem of development as being womens exclusion from a benign process womens subordination was seen as having its roots in their exclusion from the market sphere and their limited access to and control over resources the key was then to place women in development by legislatively trying to limit discrimination and by promoting their involvement in education and employment the wid approach led to resources being targeted at women and made particularly womens significant productive or income generating contribution more visible their reproductive this paper has been prepared with inputs from the membership of the sdsn thematic group on the challenges of social inclusion gender inequalities and human rights including kwadwo appiagyei atua university of ghana legon jan egeland human rights watch todd minerson white ribbon campaign richard morgan unicef sanam naraghi anderlin international civil society action network elisabeth prgl graduate institute of international and development studies magdalena seplveda carmona un special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and valmaine toki un permanent forum on indigenous issues contribution was less well emphasised while wid advocated for greater gender equality it did not tackle the real structural problem the unequal gender roles and relations that are at the basis of gender subordination and womens exclusion this approach also focussed on what have been termed practical gender needs such as providing better access to water which would reduce the amount of time women and girls must spend in domestic activities and thus allow them more time for education or employment there was no questioning why collecting water has been constructed as a female responsibility or why improved access to water is a need of women and girls only in the s the gender and development gad approach arose out of the critique of wid gad recognised that gender roles and relations are key to improving womens lives with the term gender suggesting that a focus on both women and men is needed more recently the need to understand how gender intersects with other characteristics such as age ethnicity and sexuality has been noted the gad approach recognises that it is not sufficient to add women and girls into existing processes of development but there is also a need to problematise why they are excluded advocating that the focus should be on addressing the imbalances of power at the basis of that exclusion gad also questions the notion of development and its benign nature implying a need to shift from a narrow understanding of development as economic growth to a more social or human centred development gad projects are more holistic and seek to address womens strategic gender interests by seeking the elimination of institutionalised forms of discrimination for instance around land rights or ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from violence for example molyneux moser the s witnessed the rise of rights as many ngos and agencies adopted a rights based approach to development rights increase the recognition that womens demands are legitimate claims the most notable success for the womens movement has perhaps been the establishment of sexual and reproductive rights as such within this has been recognition of womens right to live free from violence and a broadening of understanding of violence against women from domestic to gender based there was also a shift in understanding development as meaning economic development to a more holistic social development focus yet economic growth remains the main driver for the majority of large development organisations and agencies the wid approach has now largely been replaced by gad which has been institutionalised within the notion of gender mainstreaming mainstreaming involves ensuring that a gendered perspective is central to all activities including planning implementation and monitoring of all programmes projects and legislation while critiqued if undertaken merely as a tick box exercise gender mainstreaming offers a potential for placing gender at the heart of development however womens rights particularly sexual and reproductive health rights are not universally accepted as rights and violence against women remains prevalent across the globe and women still lack full and equal participation in economic and political life mainstreaming has yet to succeed and there is a need for a continued prioritisation of integrating women into development evidence on the importance of women to economic development the most influential evidence on the importance of women to economic development has come from research used to support the world banks gender mainstreaming strategy launched in dollar and gatti klasen this research highlighted that societies that discriminate by gender tend to experience less rapid economic growth and poverty reduction than societies that treat males and females more equally and that social gender disparities produce economically inefficient outcomes world bank a for example it is shown that if african countries had closed the gender gap in schooling between and as quickly as east asia did this would have produced close to a doubling of per capita income growth in the region wbgdg the primary pathways through which gender systems affect growth are by influencing the productivity of labour and the allocative efficiency of the economy world bank in terms of productivity for example if the access of women farmers to productive inputs and human capital were on a par with mens access total agricultural output could increase by an estimated to percent world bank b in terms of allocative efficiency while increases in household income are generally associated with reduced child mortality risks the marginal impact is almost times as large if the income is in the hands of the mother rather than the father wbgdg identification of women as being a reliable productive and cheap labour force makes them the preferred workforce for textiles and electronic transnational corporations perception of women as good with money including being better at paying back loans has led them to be targeted in microfinance programmes recognition of women as more efficient distributors of goods and services within the household has led to them being targeted with resources aimed at alleviating poverty such as cash transfer programmes the above shows how the justification for including women in development in economic growth has been an efficiency argument with equity concerns being somewhat secondary critics suggest this instrumentalist approach to engendering development while bringing economic growth gains will not fundamentally change the position and situation of women it is important to note that while gender equality will help bring economic growth economic growth will not necessarily bring gender equality advancing gender equality requires strengthening different dimensions of womens autonomy economic and political autonomy full citizenship and freedom from all forms of violence and sexual and reproductive autonomy alpzar durn constraints on realising the full potential of women in the process of economic development investment in the human capital health and education of women and girls is presented as a key way forward as witnessed by the mdgs the logic is that educated healthy women are more able to engage in productive activities find formal sector employment earn higher incomes and enjoy greater returns to schooling than are uneducated women wbgdg educated women are more likely to invest in the education of their own children and they are also more likely to have fewer children thus investment in human capital has positive short and longer term inter generational outcomes and is good for both productivity gains and limiting unsustainable population growth however attention has narrowly focussed on ensuring the equal access of girls to primary education inequality of access to secondary and higher education persists as does the limited engagement of girls in the study of science and technology limiting the future life and employment options of adolescent girls willingness to school feed and provide healthcare to girls is far more strongly determined by income and the costs of providing these services than is the case for boys sens million missing women is testimony to how girls are discriminated against in terms of the allocation of household resources to the point that it creates a gender imbalance in some societies and countries families are often unwilling to invest in the education of girls if this investment is not perceived as bringing them direct economic gains girls are valued only as wives and mothers and or marriage transfers any potential future gains from this investment to another family as in girls marries before the age of in the developing world unfpa early and forced marriage remains a key issue and an important factor limiting young womens engagement in both education and economic activities justice institutions from the police to the courts continue to deny womens right to justice women and girls remain unable to access justice given that in many countries there are still laws that discriminate against women in relation to the family property citizenship and employment justice systems also do not meet the needs of specific groups of women such as indigenous women who are discriminated against and face violence in the public and private spheres based on both gender and race unpfii cultural factors limit womens rights and engagement in the workplace religion still has a key role to play in determining gender norms in many cultures and fundamentalist views across the spectrum of religions threaten or deny womens rights including rights related to sex and sexualities and to mobility and employment economic fundamentalism policies and practices that privilege profits over people also deny women their rights as workers and to work while political culture is important for bringing change women continue to have a limited voice at the local and national levels and women are not able to fully participate in formal systems of power in the majority of cultures unequal gender and generational relations exist within households with the male head having a high level of control a woman going out to work is often read by others as meaning the man is unable to provide for his family making men reluctant and thus limiting womens engagement in paid work through violence or the threat of violence when women do engage in paid work it can improve their voice in the home and ability to influence household decision making it can also lead to conflict in the home especially if women earn more than men or womens employment coincides with mens under or unemployment in the last decades a crisis in masculinity has been recognised relating to the changes in mens roles and positions through processes of globalisation suggesting a need to focus attention on men if these changes are to bring transformative progress towards greater equality rather than further harm women women continue to suffer limited mobility and in some cultures women are not able to leave the home if not accompanied by a man effectively negating any type of paid employment even when women are allowed to leave they may face verbal sexual and physical abuse from unknown males for being in the street and face gossip and stigma within their own communities the growing levels and extremes of violence against women have been captured in the notion of femicide the killing of women by men just for being women including honour killings in mexico for example the term femicide has been used to describe female factory workers being killed for going against gender norms and engaging in paid work outside the home one in three women across the globe will experience violence at some stage in her lifetime violence against women and girls or the threat of violence be it physical sexual or emotional both in the private and public spheres at the hands of known and unknown men remains a key limiting factor to womens mobility and engagement in processes of development women who work at home have limited opportunities while women are very engaged in agriculture this is generally subsistence rather than cash crops it is estimated that women own only of property and lack of rights to inherit or own land which severely limits womens engagement in larger scale cash crop production even when women can inherit land the need for male protection or labour may mean they will give the land to male relatives lack of land ownership may also stop them participating in schemes to improve agricultural output while lack of wider assets disallows them from accessing loans given their lower asset base women farmers may be most affected by climate change and while having knowledge of how to adapt they may be least able to adopt appropriate adaptation strategies world bank research has highlighted how the poor are less likely to engage in higher risk return activities and the result is that the return on their assets is lower than for wealthier households holzmann and jrgensen while not a gendered analysis womens relative poverty lack of assets and lack of experience might mean they are particularly risk averse keeping them from higher return economic initiatives however women have been shown to use micro finance effectively to develop small enterprises and are recognised as good at paying back loans when women are in paid employment they are more likely to be engaged in part time rather than full time work in the informal rather than the formal sector and across the globe women earn less than men for comparable work during the recent financial crisis measures to protect the poor through employment programmes have not considered the gendered dimensions of crisis yet women may have been more severely affected than men and in more diverse ways economic and financial crises cannot be seen in isolation from food fuel water environment human rights and care crises awid women face particular risks during disaster which climate change may increase and during conflict in particular the risk of physical and sexual violence increases agencies not only fail to protect women and girls but their reproductive and particularly their productive needs are often overlooked in crisis response and peacebuilding while remunerated work is important for women it is important to remember that women still undertake the bulk of unpaid work in the home household plot or family business they have the primary responsibility for caring for children and older people as well responsibility for undertaking activities such as collection of water or firewood women play the key role in the care economy which not only provides care to the young old and the sick but also is vital for ensuring a productive workforce as this work is not remunerated it is undervalued and lies outside general conceptualisations of the economy women engaged in paid work often face a double work day since they may only be allowed to work as long as their domestic duties are still fulfilled this means women are time poor and the time burden may impact on their health and wellbeing to alleviate this burden and free women to enter paid work daughters may be taken out of school to cover the domestic work with related negative impacts on their education and ability to seek remunerated work in the future womens continued inability to control their own fertility means that childbirth limits their ability to engage in productive activities even when reproductive health services are provided this is not enough to ensure womens ability to access them men may see the decision over if and when to have children to be their decision and large numbers of children may be read as a sign of male fertility and power which becomes more important when masculinity is threatened in many cultures discussion of sexualities remains taboo denying access and rights to those who do not conform to the heterosexual norm the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescent girls in particular may be overlooked and they may be denied access to reproductive health services if they are unmarried research establishes a link between education and womens ability to control their fertility studies also show that paid work can promote greater understanding of sexual and reproductive rights among women womens socially constructed altruistic behaviour means that economic resources that enter the household via women are more likely to be spent on household and childrens needs female headed households may not be the poorest of the poor as popularly constructed since women who live with men may suffer secondary poverty the household overall is not poor but as the man withholds income for personal consumption women and children within the household are poor chant when women earn men may withhold even more of their income leaving women and children with access to the same level of resources but improving the position of women through greater control of those resources this irresponsibility of men has meant women have been targeted within poverty reduction and social policy initiatives while the targeting of women with resources is welcome the associated feminisation of obligation and responsibility chant for delivering policy outcomes may not only marginalise men but add further to womens existing triple burden of reproductive productive and community management work it may privilege their reproductive over their productive role and reinforce women as mothers rather than workers care needs to be taken to ensure that programmes serve womens needs and women are not merely placed at the service of these policy agendas molyneux it is important to remember that policies to promote economic development that include women but do not tackle the structural inequalities at the basis of their exclusion may bring growth gains but will not necessarily bring gender equality gains priority areas of intervention necessary to unblock these constraints womens groups and movements across the globe continue to promote as fundamental the need to respect and defend womens sexual and reproductive health rights womens groups and movements also continue to be fundamental to promoting these rights but many find themselves under threat for this focus sexual and reproductive rights are critical for social and economic development without these rights women and adolescent girls cannot make decisions around fertility repeated childbirth keeps them from income generating activities and reduces productivity and early and forced marriage keeps young women from education and employment sexual emotional and physical violence and the threat of violence limits womens mobility confines women to the home and keeps them from engaging fully in processes of social and economic development men and boys can have a role to play in the prevention of gender based violence and the promotion of gender equality threats to womens rights exist on many levels including those posed by culture religion and tradition as well as processes of globalisation and economic change a right gained is not a right maintained unless there is constant monitoring of rights there is a need to strengthen womens access to both formal and informal justice systems and ensure these are responsive to advancing all womens equal rights opportunity and participation improving womens political voice is also crucial here womens responsibility for unpaid domestic work makes them time poor as well as more economically dependent on men yet is vital for ensuring a healthy and productive workforce while investment in infrastructure such as water sanitation and electricity is important to ease the time burden associated with these tasks it does not change how unpaid work and the care economy is conceptualised and valued financial environmental and health crises intensify the need for care services with the care burden falling disproportionately on women and girls policies to provide affordable quality child care and adequate healthcare services would not only free women to enter paid employment but also help change care work from being understood as a domestic responsibility to a collective responsibility this change in how care work is conceptualised and valued should be a longer term goal in the short term there is a need to create full decent productive employment opportunities for women and access to finance as well as continue to provide social protection and more importantly promote and value women as good with money key for economic growth is the promotion of womens economic rights which entails promoting a range of womens rights their sexual and reproductive rights and rights to education to mobility to voice to ownership and to

involvement in decision making valuing social cohesion and diversity engaging other key actors measuring social inclusion and access to rights conclusion introduction creating a world where the equal dignity and worth of every individual is respected and valued is simple to articulate but difficult to deliver the universal declaration of human rights udhr was a powerful statement of intent and attempts have been made to create legislative administrative and judicial mechanisms to ensure these values are upheld the devastation of world war ii highlighted the need and acceptance for human rights and mobilized the political will to create a framework that could enshrine basic protection for all a standard has now emerged to which countries and communities across the world subscribe and aspire the success of the universality of human rights can be judged against a the proliferation of human rights legal standards b the emphases placed on human rights within state practice and c the take up of human rights norms by international institutions there have been advances in who is explicitly covered by these standards with notable advancements for the rights of women and children in how inclusionary the protection emanating from these is and in the extent to which they cover the full range of rights there have also been significant advances for group rights initially marginalized within the human rights framework the processes currently underway to define a set of internationally agreed goals for the period to provide an opportunity to consolidate these advances this report highlights the limits of the existing development and rights agendas and suggests steps needed to ensure an agenda that moves beyond poverty reduction to focus on social inclusion as an overarching aim placing de facto equality at the heart of global sustainable development agenda this report suggests solutions reflecting good practice that could provide blueprints for the future drawn from societies around the world that are attempting to ensure fairer and more equal societies moving beyond current practice human rights have gained acceptance as universal standards to strive for and provide a framework for development albeit with deficiencies the rights discourse has been critiqued for presenting rights as universal when in fact they validate western values other criticisms point to double standards some states are singled out as violators while those deemed allies are exempt from criticism despite these major difficulties the notion of rights has captured popular imaginations across the globe and marginalized groups particularly women indigenous peoples and minorities have used the discourse of rights as a powerful tool to articulate their claims high among these claims is the continued need for protection from violence and conflict there is also increased convergence around the need for socio economic rights for excluded communities this suggests that rather than moving away from the rights discourse there is need to change how rights are understood and operationalized economic social and cultural rights rights were presented as universal and indivisible civil and political rights were prioritized and presented as those most in need of protection by contrast economic social and cultural rights esc rights were construed as falling within governmental social policy this distinction was exacerbated by the location of the emerging rights regime within law as a series of nationally guaranteed legislative judicial and administrative measures rights thus became a series of promises made by the state to its people that could be gained through legal challenge within this framework esc rights were often subject to the caveat that their enjoyment was subject to progressive realization the rights articulated on socio economic issues were not promises that could be adjudicated upon in a court of law but aspirations to be strived for by governments the emerging rights framework was not linked to the development discourse and issues such as poverty were conceptualized within an economic rather than rights rhetoric the sustainable development agenda affords the opportunity to re conceptualize poverty with poverty eradication as a right with economic growth designed to serve the achievement of this goal and a complementary legal framework administrative legislative and at times judicial to guarantee the aim to eradicate poverty a broad spectrum of rights needs to be fulfilled for example an individuals right to work requires fulfillment of rights such as personal security and freedom of movement e g in order to seek jobs these rights also need balancing against environmental rights if sustainable development is to be achieved thus it remains imperative to return to the notion of indivisible rights and rather that privileging civil and political rights to understand these as interconnected with socio economic rights this would enable a holistic understanding of how poverty can be overcome something an overly legalistic understanding of rights would restrict to i ascertainment of blame ii determination of costs of violation and iii deterrent legislation to avoid the phenomenon in future in the new period of sustainable development it is imperative to interrogate and incorporate human rights from economic sociological political and gendered lenses womens and group rights the issue of gender highlights the limitation of rights as currently constructed the udhr reflects a male centric post war conceptualization of rights while violence against women and girls vawg and marital rape could be understood as cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the gender neutral language does not explicitly recognize these specific violations in legal terms vawg been conceptualized as domestic violence and thus as a private matter between man and wife not one for public intervention the emphasis within the rights framework lay on protection of the individual rather than groups or communities with no recognition of violations that were collectively experienced by a group more recently the term femicide has been adopted to represent the killing of women for behaving badly or challenging gender norms this takes different forms in different cultures including honor killings the persistent rape and violence against adivasi women in india and deaths of women factory workers for challenging gender norms and engaging in paid work outside the home women are targeted not because of individual characteristics but for representing a group envisaged as playing a set role within society an overt legal focus on prosecuting perpetrators and protecting victims fails to challenge underlying structural causes which require societal responses while advances have been made legal frameworks struggle to afford protection against collective violations against specific vulnerable groups over reliance on a system where rights can be effectively challenged in a court of law fails to acknowledge the fundamental inequalities that restrict access to world health organization understanding and addressing violence against women femicide available online at http apps who int iris handle such systems for women indigenous peoples and other minorities social exclusion is particularly manifest in legal systems at the level of advocacy judicial determination and within the legislative process while proscribing certain behavior as illegal is a first step establishing a right does not automatically facilitate its fulfillment to escape violence women need more than laws they need to be able to live independently to be able to earn an income to own property to farm land and to have society recognize these rights legal mechanisms remain insufficient for bringing excluded voices into the heart of socio legal policy over development and rights thus the rights of such marginalized groups must be prioritized and ways to fulfill them outside formal justice systems must also be promoted cultural relativism remains a key challenge to be overcome which pertains directly to indigenous peoples minorities and women sexual and reproductive rights for instance are contested rights not recognized in many cultures there is then a growing need to ensure all rights for all and to find ways to negotiate cultural differences to make sure rights are used to promote and protect society against harmful processes and practices human rights and development the relatively recent anchoring of human rights to the development paradigm is particularly useful donor agencies and some development ngos have sought to connect their work to human rights through a rights based approach to development while positive care needs to be taken around this linkage to ensure that the human rights discourse is not dominated by agents of developmentalism the position of international organizations such as the world trade organization on issues such as intellectual property rights and its negative impact on poverty reduction sustainability of food production environmental conditions and the health of the poor in developing countries is a manifestation of a trend that needs to be challenged financial institutions have also adopted rights and equality rhetoric that could dilute its meaning for instance the world bank promotes gender equality as an efficient means to increase productivity improve economic growth and reduce population growth while this is based on sound research promoting it in this manner makes gender parity an incidental objective rather than an imperative question of equal rights poverty reduction projects focused on women are also often presented as fostering gender equality for gender equality to be achieved requires specific actions that address structural gendered inequalities unlikely to be achieved as convenient collateral to other policies providing services to women ensuring access to health and education and employment and credit are important and changing gender roles can have a positive effect on gender relations however this is not automatically the case since for example improving womens access to income does not necessarily improve their control over that income nor improve womens voice in the home creating job opportunities for women is important but there is also a need to explicitly promote womens right to work there is also a need to explicitly address unequal power relations at all levels including within the home if real change is to be achieved policies need not only to change gender roles but also challenge existing unequal gender relations and to promote womens access to services and resources as rights it is then important to avoid simple solutions that do not challenge structural inequalities and local contexts it is also important to ensure that the overuse of the language of inclusion justice equality and rights does not diminish its meaning and power creating convenient rhetoric that circumvents real issues the donor community appears to view the adoption of liberal democracy by every country accompanied by a constitution guaranteeing rights as prima facie affirmation of a states human rights credentials this approach placed emphasis on good governance as a criterion for decisions concerning disbursement of aid but it fails to assess critical issues affecting social inclusion such as unequal power structures the environment and the proliferation of poverty and often introduces artificial elements for societies in transition that work against the longer term interests of building sustainable and inclusive communities human rights have focused on naming and shaming states many international instruments were negotiated and ratified as intergovernmental agreements and failures to uphold their principles was akin to one party to a contract failing to uphold norms agreed to within that contract this approach often foreclosed room for collaborative work between states those keen to find solutions for the implementation of rights and human rights defenders while there remains a role for states in holding other states to account if they violate international agreements there is also room for more collaborative processes to bring states into line with international consensus while states clearly bear obligations under law not every violation of human rights is the result of state inaction or unwillingness to act focusing on states as the sole liable actors for violations means that opportunities for behavioral change and adoption of responsibility for others such as the corporate sector were missed the processes of human rights have also placed overt emphasis at the international level while major innovations and human rights friendly social policy solutions often emanate at the national and sub national levels any assessment of law making within states highlights how structural inequalities are constructed through legislative mechanisms and unless awareness grows for wider articulation of political voices inequalities will persist and be reproduced a failure to correct the trajectory of human rights law to make it focus on the needs and challenges faced by women vulnerable and other marginalized communities would allow current inequalities borne on structural fault lines to persist into the future the post framework should therefore ensure that the language of human rights articulated in terms of the diminution of inequality and equality of outcomes features strongly in the sustainable development goals sdgs across goals targets and indicators seek guarantees that the sdg framework emphasizes the importance of administrative legal frameworks conducive to combating inequality and social exclusions in all its forms promote women and girls sexual and reproductive rights emphasize the need for active collaboration not antagonism between human rights mechanisms governments civil society and business seek ways to address the structural causes that deny marginalized groups including women their rights overcoming structural causes of inequality with economic growth as the dominant paradigm poverty could be viewed as resulting from inadequate incomes and productivities particularly in agriculture and other rural activities and in the urban informal sector due to inadequate access to educational and other services the poors relative lack of market power feeds into weak political power via undemocratic structures they are also less likely to engage in higher risk return activities and the result is that the return on their assets is lower than for wealthier households while this is important in explaining the preponderance of poverty these are also outcomes rather than causes of poverty with inadequate incomes productivities and weak political power arising from structural inequalities as demonstrated in the following four policy areas macroeconomic sound macroeconomic policies are a prerequisite for economic stability growth and reducing poverty yet poorly designed policies can undermine the goal of social sustainability rigidly market centered prescriptions over the past decades have increased inequalities in many countries there is an urgent need to re embed macro economic and fiscal policy within the broader framework of social objectives since growth alone does not lead to social justice research has shown that societies that discriminate by gender tend to experience less rapid economic growth and poverty reduction than societies that treat males and females equally and that gender disparities produce economically inefficient outcomes extreme inequalities reinforce poverty and can act as a barrier to growth by restricting the productive potential of a large section of the population in turn highly unequal countries have been shown to be less able to convert growth into poverty reduction while greater equality may be important for economic growth care is needed as growth is not necessarily good for equality the question is what type of growth is best for poverty reduction and which policies will help to bring about more equitable patterns of growth the focus needs to be on growth with equity or pro poor growth strategies the promotion of the economic rights of marginalized groups may hold the key for future more equitable economic growth for instance fulfilling womens economic rights entails promoting a range of womens rights such as their right to control fertility to education to ownership and to mobility in some cultures women are unable to leave home if unaccompanied by men effectively negating paid employment women play key roles in the care economy which provides care to the young old and the sick and ensures a productive work force this unremunerated work is under valued and lies outside general conceptualizations of the economy when women are allowed to leave home to work they may face verbal sexual and physical abuse from unknown males or face gossip and stigma within their communities to promote the wellbeing of women as well as the economy economic policy needs to improve womens engagement in paid work by tackling killick t may making adjustment

norms that value women as good with money in order to ensure access to and control over resources they and their households generate inequality of access and control over resources while reducing absolute poverty is an important target tackling relative poverty defined as the percentage of households in a country that earn less than half the median household income in that country is equally important in many countries there are a disproportionate number of minorities indigenous peoples and women among the poor this income inequality is directly related to their lower access to and control over resources sens million missing women is testimony to how girls are discriminated against in terms of the allocation of household resources to the point that it creates a gender imbalance in some societies and countries willingness to school feed and provide health care to girls is strongly determined by income and the costs of providing these services more so than for boys this is related to the low value given to girls and to socially constructed gender roles that place women as mothers and carers while men are more valued as providers and protectors womens poverty is caused at community labor market and household levels three factors contribute to womens relative poverty first women have fewer possibilities to translate work into income stemming from i exclusive responsibility for reproductive work ii the conceptualization of their productive activities as helping men and iii concentration within sectors which are either an extension of their reproductive roles and thus lower paid and or within the informal economy second when women do have an income they find it difficult to convert this into decision making capacity perceptions around value of contribution to the household social norms and self esteem relative autonomy influence the capacity to have a voice in decision making processes finally when women make decisions they are less likely to take decisions that improve their personal wellbeing and more likely to seek to improve the wellbeing of others this supposed altruism stemming from perceived natural attributes as carers and mothers is a socially constructed conceptualization of what it means to be a woman and is exacerbated by womens almost exclusive responsibility for domestic unpaid work while investment in infrastructure such as water sanitation and electricity is important to ease the time burden associated with these tasks it does not change how unpaid work and the care economy is conceptualized and valued a changed conceptualization of the valuation of such work should be a longer term goal in the short term policies to provide affordable quality child care and adequate health care services would free women to enter paid employment and more importantly change care work from being a domestic responsibility to a collective responsibility women have been targeted by poverty reduction and social policy initiatives many of these initiatives have been shown to be effective but they dont tackle the underlying socially constructed sen a more than million women are missing new york review of books bradshaw s gendered poverties and power relations looking inside communities and households la pobreza no es la misma ni es igual relaciones de poder dentro y fuera del hogar managau nicaragua puntos de encuentro often irresponsible behavior of men targeting resources towards women is welcome but where these are conditional on achieving policy outcomes such as improving school attendance or infant nutritional levels the associated feminization of obligation and responsibility may not only marginalize men but also add further to womens existing triple burden of reproductive productive and community management work it may privilege their reproductive over their productive role and reinforce women as mothers rather than workers while good social services and social protection programs are a necessity these programs should serve womens as well as childrens needs a similar paradigm can be seen with poverty reduction policies directed towards minorities and indigenous peoples rather than seeking to empower communities towards greater inclusion within closed societies these effectively keep them subjugated as outsiders within a system reliant on handouts causing further resentment and exclusion in the case of all vulnerable groups policies directed towards their empowerment are to be welcomed however their content approach and objectives need to be considered carefully social services while providing quality and affordable health and education services is a key element for eradicating poverty and improving wellbeing for all people investment in human capital has been seen as of particular importance for minorities indigenous peoples women and girls the gains to be made from the investment in services for these groups are individual and collective for example if african countries had closed the gender gap in schooling between and as quickly as east asia did it may have produced close to a doubling of per capita income growth in the region educated women are more likely to engage in productive activities and enjoy greater returns from them than uneducated women similarly minorities and indigenous peoples that are fully immersed in a society add to the economic clout of that society and increase the size of the consumer base and market ensuring the education of women is likely to increase investment in the education of their own children and is also likely to result in fewer children easing population pressure thus investment in human capital has positive short and longer term outcomes and is good for both productivity gains and population decline while education is important for economic growth equality of access to all levels of education should be a goal in itself and education should be used not just to improve productivity but to promote social justice and to challenge social norms inequality of access to secondary and higher education persists as does limited engagement of girls in the study of science and technology limiting the future life and employment options of adolescent girls as one in girls gets married before the age of in the developing world early and forced marriage remains a key issue and

to ensure womens ability to access them men often decide if and when to have children with large numbers of children still read as a sign of male fertility and power becoming more important when masculinity is threatened in many cultures discussion of sexualities remains taboo denying access and rights to those who do not conform to the heterosexual norm the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescent girls in particular may be overlooked and they may be denied access to reproductive health services if they are unmarried womens groups and movements across the globe continue to promote the need to respect and defend womens sexual and reproductive rights and are fundamental to promoting these rights though many find themselves under threat for this emphasis it remains imperative that adequate reproductive health services are provided for all that there is a formalization of sexual and reproductive rights as such and legal protection is provided for those that seek to promote these contested rights domestic legal frameworks while human rights have been successful in norm creation awareness raising and establishing rights on the agenda of the international community the mechanisms have had limited impact on many of the issues above due to a host of factors including the nature and content of the frameworks created the manner in which they have been applied the failure to heed the voices of excluded communities especially women as a group and women from excluded communities and the hesitation on the part of the chief actors including states and the international community towards a focus on domestic implementation of international standards the administrative systems in over percent of the worlds states derive from western models usually disseminated through colonial practices this has restricted the number and types of models available and has often established westernized administrative systems in places far removed from their origin the lack of technology and access in the past restricted the extent to which southern models could be studied adapted and adopted yet many postcolonial societies have struggled hard against inequalities and social exclusion and have learnt important policy lessons in the process that need to be disseminated this is perhaps most obvious in the context of the administrative mechanisms that are being developed and applied in various parts of the world bradshaw s womens decision making in rural and urban households in nicaragua the influence of income and ideology environment and

and keane d p minority rights in the pacific a comparative legal analysis oxford university press castellino j and cavanaugh k minority rights in the middle east oxford university press with many states calling for technical co operation in the field of human rights it is important that alternative models are proposed always reserving a strong voice for civil society the pooling of global administrative experiences is likely to yield results and will give the task of human rights implementation the feel of a shared journey among states and between states international organizations and civil society both international and grassroots human rights groups work through lobbying governments and keeping pressure upon them to fulfill the international human rights obligations while such naming and shaming can highlight poor implementations and violations it offers little by way of concrete solutions and models to address the implementation gap the un human rights councils universal periodic review has demonstrated that tools other than naming and shaming are effective for greater recognition of rights this may be particularly the case in gender terms where cultural norms need to be balanced against western values justice systems rarely meet the needs of specific groups of women and indigenous women and women from other marginalized groups face particular discrimination and violence sexual emotional and physical violence and the threat of violence limits womens mobility confines women to the home and keeps them from engaging fully in processes of social and economic development women and girls remain unable to access justice and to use the existing legal standards given that in many countries there are still laws that discriminate against women in relation to the family property citizenship and employment the overt focus on individual rather than collective rights derived from western origin laissez faire governance models does not help confront such social exclusion which needs instead collective solutions since the violations inevitably have a communitarian element disconnecting it from this context will allow stronger voices to gain their rights while leaving others behind reliance on advocacy as the sole tool available to gain rights may result in excluded communities slipping further away from social policy makers if the only way to gain their rights is through expensive inaccessible processes legislative processes are also ineffective for most vulnerable communities whose access is limited by their relative exclusion from political participation and weak access to justice some are sensitive to their causes and try to pass laws that seek to promote social inclusion and political participation against this any focus on communitarian and collective rights needs to be particularly mindful of the extent to which stronger voices within communities articulate collective positions to the exclusion of other segments of that population the impact of this is most visible in the case of women and thus any indicators developed on collective rights would need to be gender sensitive the differential access to and control over resources and to social services coupled with current constructions of both the macro economic and legal frameworks reproduce rather than tackle structural inequalities that are the root causes of poverty and limit wellbeing these inequalities may be further exacerbated by ongoing global trends such as climate change conflict and financial crises dominguez redondo e universal periodic review

poor and marginalized populations who are often further away from acceding any potential remedies to such degradation vulnerable populations tend to i depend the most on natural environment for their livelihoods ii live in areas that are particularly prone to environmental degradation and iii are least able to protect themselves against the effect of environmental degradation given their lower asset base women farmers may be most affected by climate change and while having the knowledge may be least able to adopt appropriate adaptation strategies conflict over scarce resources conflict over scarce resources is likely to become more common and intense as population pressure local environmental degradation and global environmental change in particular climate change combine to put pressure on vulnerable communities the resulting fragility is evident in the drylands where pastoralist communities often compete with sedentary farmers over scarce water resources and grazing grounds and in mining communities post conflict and post disaster individual and institutionalized land grabbing is an important problem facing the poor and vulnerable including women and girls who may lose their rights to access to and control over land demographic changes and fertility rates population growth and fertility rates tend to be highest in poor countries and among poor people particularly in rural areas in addition to living in subsistence conditions this places inordinately high burdens on women in particular curtailing their contribution to every other aspect of community life relegating them to second class status within communities having large numbers of children early in life increases maternal mortality disempowers women lowers per capita investments in children and increases child mortality rates and poor education outcomes voluntary and forced migration flows human migratory flows will likely grow in volume and involve the movement of men and women as well as families they are likely to become more dispersed with growing numbers of people seeking refuge in todays emerging countries such flows create misery for many migrants especially women leaving them in situations of isolation and vulnerability they also put pressure on weaker populations in host countries sowing the seeds for conflict and putting a downward pressure on wages and impacting labor markets they also

vulnerabilities for women children and the aged who often have to manage a households scarce resources or are relegated to work in precarious conditions for wages below subsistence levels uncontrolled urban growth is also creating a peri urban culture where people live in unsanitary conditions that pose major health risks and a threat to the environment the desertion of rural communities by the youth leaving only the aged women and children behind poses a great threat to food security and agricultural production in general efforts by governments to provide basic social amenities in rural communities and incentives to reverse or stall the rural urban drift will be critical to dealing with this challenge corruption according to the african union more than us billion is lost to corruption in africa every year equivalent to percent of africas gdp corrupt public officials receive between us and us billion in bribes annually which is equivalent of to percent of official

rise in reported bribery is also associated with higher maternal deaths in states regardless of a country s wealth or how much it invests in health data for countries show that people s access to safe drinking water falls as bribery increases such data highlight the deep interconnections in the relationship between corruption human rights and poverty suppression of civil and political rights such as access to information freedom of expression assembly and freedom of movement denies citizens the means to expose and prevent corruption while the festering of corruption leads to violations of esc rights there is therefore the need to curb corruption to provide social capital for the poor to deal with social exclusion and lack of power to influence their lives armed violence as voices for democracy have grown non democratic regimes such as those in the middle east and north africa have come under increased pressure to change from within their populations while the voices of protest need to be understood and supported in their legitimate quest for greater participation and equality protests in autocratic societies create a precarious environment in which minorities and women are increasingly threatened indicators suggest that such protests are likely to rise as populations gain greater voice and seek to participate in a robust manner to make their communities fairer the threat of violent responses to these protests has grown governments increasingly view protests with suspicion and seek to quell them in every manner available having a proactive international approach

increase agencies not only fail to protect women and girls but their reproductive and their productive needs are often overlooked in crisis response and peace building pathways toward sustainable development while the global processes described in the previous section suggest a bleak future the post process represents a real opportunity to make policy oriented decisions that address these issues there are positive lessons to be learned from those already seeking to overcome these obstacles and potential solutions to what seem to be insurmountable problems may lie in these small scale and local initiatives physical security the right to physical security is a fundamental human right without which any economic growth gains improved incomes and services provided would be meaningless in recent years large magnitude natural disasters have impacted the lives of many leaving death disability and destruction in their wake the earthquake in haiti demonstrated how the lack of development could make populations more vulnerable and less able to recover hurricanes katrina and sandy highlighted that even developed nations are not immune and that minority and indigenous communities are often disproportionately affected across the globe many live in insecurity in fear of violent attacks or going about their daily lives under siege the line between combatant and civilian has become blurred making the ability to ensure physical security increasingly difficult some recent international humanitarian interventions have shown that those that aim to protect may now be as much targets as welcome providers of relief much like health has been constructed around illness rather than wellbeing the global focus has been on conflict or disaster rather than human security there is need to change this conceptualization if the right to physical security is to be attained at present there is a separation between humanitarian actors who provide relief during and immediately after an event and development actors who enter later once peace is established or normal services resumed the uks department for international developments dfid recent call to embed humanitarian actions into development and to disaster proof development is a step forward in this context especially when linked with its recent work on understanding conflict and disaster as gendered

https www gov uk government uploads system uploads attachment data file herr pdf eradication of gender based violence gender based violence gbv is widespread and undermines human rights by i directly hindering the enjoyment of rights by the victims ii failing to support equality in all aspects of life and iii creating a culture of fear and domination that significantly undermines the ability of girls and women to play a full and equal role within society while the right to live free from violence is fundamental tackling such violence is hindered by deep rooted cultural traditions upholding womens rights challenges patriarchal norms that accept male violence against women as normal the characterization of such violence as domestic violence further constructs it as a private not public matter and therefore somehow outside jurisdiction many countries are working to improve the rate of reporting of gender based crimes and increase convictions through integrated and specialized services to address womens access to justice and more efficient handling of gender related crimes these include reforming services at police stations and courts to ensure survivors are treated with respect as well as protocols for collecting and collating evidence and the sensitive handling of the survivors of sexual violence and abuse the more successful programs employ specially trained individuals who guide clients through the entire process including medical treatment reporting bringing a claim in court and assisting in prosecutions although such programs can help all women they are particularly important for women living in poverty who face more daunting obstacles in accessing justice one solution is such a one stop approach to reporting on gbv increasing the rates of convictions and creating a nuanced understanding of the specific needs of women in accessing the justice system in brazil the delegacias especiais de atendimento mulher are womens police stations operating across local jurisdictions they provide immediate assistance to survivors of sexual violence undertake enquiries and steer cases through brazils otherwise complicated criminal justice system the proliferation of these womens police stations has been credited with raising awareness of violence against women increasing the reporting of gbv and creating a high visibility bulwark against the prevalence of gbv in south africa the sexual offences courts and the thuthuzela centres have streamlined the handling and prosecution of cases of sexual abuse through the instigation of integrated investigatory processes the dispensation of the necessary health care and the provision of counseling legal and police services this program sends a clear message in terms of societal values and has already increased conviction rates it has also reduced the average duration of proceedings to six months where it would previously take between three and five years the advantage of having women at the focal point is also in itself empowering and provides greater efficacy to the process of gaining rights for all legal and judicial changes could form catalysts for change in eliminating gender

range of messages such programs provoke discussion influence social convergence around societal norms and depict actions that individuals can take to improve wellbeing and claim their rights guaranteeing legal identity social exclusion often occurs because vulnerable communities are beyond the reach of existing administrative mechanisms commencing from a failure of registration at birth bereft of registration individuals and swathes of communities are left in a void unable to access available rights and not reflected within the statistics for that society while many international agencies have sought to focus on the registration of the birth of every child this call has often been less heeded by national authorities and not monitored closely by international bodies yet in order to tackle social exclusion this is a vital step without which another generation could be excluded concerted efforts are required to understand the barriers to registration and to understand the broad geographic element to failures of registration among those who experience failures of registration are the most vulnerable excluded groups ethnic minorities indigenous peoples stateless communities persons with disabilities and undocumented migrants particular attention needs to be paid to gender within excluded communities since lack of registration of the girl child is often linked to the perception of her limited value to the family and society the antidote to registration failures lies in making such processes free simple to access and understand and available at the most local of levels the success of registration processes can be gauged by whether they provide multiple registration avenues and by the cost of such processes technological improvements could yield mobile registration units door to door outreach programs integration of registration services in hospitals reproductive health services vaccination programs local stores and banks cambodia has seen a dramatic improvement in mass registration through such processes thanks to a partnership between the government and international actors which resulted in a mass mobile registration campaign bringing million unregistered people within the fold from to data from plan international highlights the variety of measures used details the reforms that were made to the registration law and explains the

cambodia jobs also lag behind in national statistics women are disproportionately represented in agriculture and in the informal sector where they often work under conditions that trap them in low levels of productivity two major constraints that maintain this status quo are the lack of access to land and credit for women minorities and indigenous peoples while the spread of micro credit programs has begun to address womens lack of capital these have not been targeted towards minorities and indigenous peoples to the same degree women and minorities including minority women remain land poor in the case of indigenous peoples traditional claims to territory have been overturned and fundamental questions remain around as to how traditional ownership over lands and its resources can be recognized although no reliable figures exist it is estimated that land ownership by women is less than percent worldwide while percent of the total workload in planting and in care for domestic animals is carried out by women in sub saharan africa reasons for low ownership of land among women vary rights to land and property are a complex issue and simply issuing titles does not change the underlying social factors that determine who is seen to have the right to it property ownership is often considered to be a relationship between people and things but property relations actually signify a relationship between people and people claims to use and dispose of land arise from social relations and they can be built through fulfillment of social obligations of for example a wife to her husband or other relatives often obligations are related to whether the person is seen as able to farm the land with social norms effectively negating womens access the need for women to have male protection means that even when she can own land herself she will give land to brothers or husbands to ensure this in the indigenous context traditional claims often undocumented clash with land tenure systems and registration processes that arrived with colonial rule or settlers and often misappropriated indigenous lands through subterfuge with multinational companies especially in the mining sector keen to gain licenses to explore in such territories many clashes are emerging in response the post framework should endorse the principle of free prior informed consent for all decisions pertaining to indigenous territories ultimately to bring change in land tenure systems and make them more inclusive fundamental changes may be required to determinations of ownership many countries still restrict ownership of property to men some land registration policies assign ownership to a male household head and inheritance norms favor the traditional practice where land is passed down to sons some governments have begun to recognize the need for proactive intervention in order to change womens continued exclusion from land ownership in ethiopia the government has distributed over million land use certificates requiring that land needs to be held jointly by husbands and wives which promises an improvement towards the empowerment of women paired with increases in land related investments comparative analysis from honduras and nicaragua support this and a positive correlation can be found between womens property rights and their overall role in the household economy facilitating greater control over agricultural income higher shares of business and labor market earnings and more frequent receipt of credit other studies suggest that young women understand

earners looked to buy land as an investment for the future knowing that such a purchase would improve their bargaining power in marriage in the final analysis the post agenda needs to adopt a robust approach in combatting social norms that deny marginalized groups access to land providing access to decent work and livelihoods employment generation is a key component of any development model but in order for such a model to be just the employment needs to obey minimum core labor standard thresholds including non discrimination absence of forced and child labor and the freedom of association and collective bargaining in addition it must offer fair wages and decent working conditions labor rights have been severely jeopardized in a globalized labor market where firms compete for cheap labor and where unions and workers rights are considered an obstacle imposing undue cost workers within the informal sectors often lack basic labor rights and work under conditions that violate basic standards governing decent work while the informal sector is problematic in terms of the lack of safeguards it can provide the only means of survival for many households and for some commentators it is the real engine of growth that will spawn the future entrepreneurs the lack of rights enjoyed by many workers in the formal sector also means there has been a blurring of the distinction as the formal becomes more informal through outsourcing much of this work is undertaken by women in their homes but young women are also a favored workforce this is especially true in textiles and electronics factories where womens perceived natural ability to undertake detailed repetitive work maintain high productivity over long hours and command low wages make them an obvious choice the inclusion of women in the labor force albeit in part time menial poorly paid and low status jobs contrasts with the rise in male unemployment and under employment this erosion of the male provider protector role in part explains the crisis in masculinity documented in the academic literature such crises can cause a backlash against women as men sometimes reassert their power in the private sphere through violence young men in particular may suffer such crises resulting in overt displays of maleness especially where unemployment is high and male educational attainment is lower than for girls there is then the need for a concerted effort to ensure jobs for young women and men these jobs need to be decent and dignified and reflect the fact women and men may need and want to dedicate time to raising a family especially when their children are young trade unions remain the most effective mechanism for ensuring just wages and decent working conditions in recent years new types of unions have sprung up in particular among women workers that take account of the diverse range of dependencies among workers for example the self employed womens association in india represents informal sector workers who work on their own account and in sub contracting arrangements this union of the self employed demands labor rights for its members while at the same time organizing access to credit childcare and insurance the federacin nacional de trabajadoras del hogar de bolivia offers a similar example drawing on legal provisions in cedaw this union of domestic workers has

publishing rights these new types of unions contribute importantly to making development socially sustainable ensuring access to public services an overt focus of the future sustainable must be on the eradication of extreme poverty which is a human rights violation in itself and is the primary obstacle to the enjoyment of all other rights in many societies social protection mechanisms such as cash transfer schemes public work programs school stipends social pensions food vouchers and food transfers and user fee exemptions for health care and education established in the most impoverished and unequal societies have demonstrated how persistent inequality can be mitigated these experiences make a strong case for embedding broad based social protection systems in national social policies as already visible in the productive safety net programme ethiopia the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme india the challenging the frontiers of poverty reduction bangladesh and the pilot social cash transfer scheme kalomo district zambia school meal programs in india brazil and paraguay and the distribution of food baskets have played an important role in reducing the prevalence of hunger social protection programs have also contributed to the realization of the right to education allowing families to absorb costs associated with schooling through school feeding initiatives that provide fee waivers and subsidies as best demonstrated through the oportunidades program in mexico several studies demonstrate the contribution of such investments to increasing school enrolment rates number of accumulated education years and peer pressure that encourages non beneficiary families to send their children to school there is strong evidence collected through the offices of the un special rapporteur on extreme poverty focused on latin america to indicate that greater family access to risk management instruments unemployment benefits disability benefits etc directly reduces the prevalence of child labor in the context of health such transfers have increased the regularity of medical check ups reduced child mortality improved prospects for immunization and reduced regular illness and deaths the peruvian cash transfer program juntos has had a particularly salutary effect on maternal health reporting an increase of in prenatal and postnatal visits to health clinics and a reduction of home births in an area that previously showed high levels of maternal mortality in many instances women have been targeted as the beneficiaries of these programs the assumption being that they are responsible for taking young children for health checks ensuring their health and wellbeing and making sure children attend school care needs to be taken to ensure that such programs do not reinforce gender stereotypes around womens carer roles marginalizing men and their role in the unpaid economy not all programs have been gendered in the way opportunidades is offering greater financial incentives to families to send girls to secondary school where conditions do apply to transfers these should specifically target girls and particularly the secondary education of girls another such program the bangladesh female secondary school programme not only paid school fees but also offered a financial incentive directly to the girls payment was conditional on a number of factors including on young women remaining unmarried until the age of while the aim of limiting early marriage is a laudable the conditions may not be compatible with a rights approach and due attention needs to be paid to bringing real not imposed change some programs have provided adult women with resources such as pre and postnatal care limiting services to maternal health does not provide access to reproductive health services and does not actively promote womens reproductive health rights to decide the timing and spacing of children or their sexual rights to enjoy a healthy sex life there is then still a need to promote programs that focus on womens needs and provide services for women as rights not as an add on to other programs the impact of social protection programs varies depending on their objectives design and level of institutionalization the level of development of the countries where they are implemented is also a significant factor the need for conditions is another factor that has been debated in ethical as well as practical terms and the utility of making payments conditional on schooling or health outcomes is itself dependent on a number of factors yet whatever the criticisms there is no denying that these systems reduce the prevalence and severity of poverty improve social cohesion reduce inequality and have the potential to contribute towards the creation of sustainable and equitable societies transferring resources to those in extreme poverty allows beneficiaries to generate income protect their assets and accumulate human capital even in oecd countries it is estimated that levels of poverty and inequality are approximately half those that might be expected in the absence of social protection the idea of social protection has also gained increasing political support in the development and poverty reduction discourse the idea of non contributory minimum social protection crystallized in when the heads of united nations agencies launched the social protection floor initiative as one of nine joint initiatives to cope with the global economic and financial crises it has since received support at the un millennium summit in the gs cannes summit final declaration and in the form of ilo recommendation no guaranteeing access to information technological change offers new opportunities for delivering social services and income opportunities for the poor at the same time it is endangering the rights and freedoms of individuals particularly women and low paid workers as it changes the nature of their jobs increases a skill premium and promotes the winner takes all effect as a result inequalities within countries are likely to rise unless counteracted by active policies any developmental policy that is sensitive to the needs of social inclusion has to include a focus on technology since it tends to be harnessed and used to the exclusion of marginalized excluded and vulnerable communities a concerted policy focusing on women and technology is required to ensure that women are the beneficiaries of technology as well as able to contribute to its development and dissemination the articulation of rights frameworks tends to place little emphasis on accessibility to information especially legal information for a system that still relies heavily on legal advocates claiming rights from recalcitrant governments the lack of information flows concerning rights and remedies harms the prospect of the poorest communities gaining redress mainstreaming rights education and disseminating it through a variety of means including through adult learning is crucial for the empowerment of excluded communities legal and other materials elaborating human rights are social

violations of human rights the equipping of paralegals with skills concerning the laws in operation and on counseling could assist socially excluded communities in accessing processes that would otherwise be unfamiliar to them in addition they make the legal system more efficient eradicating the matters that can be addressed more swiftly from the overburdened justice system in this way they increase efficiency reduce caseloads divert untenable claims away from the courts and improve the effectiveness of judicial and police procedures by holding officials to account paralegals could also contribute to educating communities about their rights and making them aware of the range of remedies available to them the kampala declaration on community paralegals supported by over african organizations and over countries is testimony to the importance given to this issue in africa the declaration urges governments to strengthen access to justice across the continent and frames community paralegals as having an important role these principles have already been put in place and applied in diverse societies in kenya the centre for legal empowerment kituo cha sheria implements a paralegal project in the shimo la tewa prison specifically fulfilling a gap left by the states legal aid system the organization has trained paralegals including wardens persons on remand and convicts it has drafted over applications and letters to chief magistrates and a significant volume of applications and appeals before high courts in malindi and mombasa the high success rate of these petitions has made the work of kituo cha sheria worthy of replicating in other settings the organizations high profile victory for prisoners right to vote in a landmark case has focused attention on this relatively ignored group the paralegal advisory service in malawi operates in a similar manner in a country where less than lawyers serve a population of more than million the service trains individuals in criminal law and procedure interviewing skills and information management and the paralegals then provide legal advice training and coordination between different justice agencies the service has achieved coverage of the prison population and has had dramatic effects in reducing the remand under trial prison population a similar venture in sierra leone run by the ngo timap for justice literally stand up for justice commenced in has had a similar impact in pioneering community based available at http www namati org news newsfeed kampala declaration for more information see

empowerment practitioners perspectives rome international development law organization approaches to solving questions emanating within the judicial system timaps work is supported by lawyers who engage customary litigation mechanisms for redress of intractable legal issues a capacity which provides greater efficacy to the work of the paralegals the impact of the organization can be seen in governmental recognition for the need to develop a national paralegal program based on the organizations work and has also been validated by the world bank who found strong evidence of empowerment in timaps work increasing public participation and involvement in decision making the lack of effective political participation is a key reason why inequality and subordination are perpetuated for women minorities and indigenous peoples women and minorities often participate extensively in grassroots activism but formal politics is often beyond the reach of the marginalized and vulnerable as a result issues germane to their progress receive scant attention various forms of quotas have had some impact on the formal political participation of women and minorities more than one hundred countries today have either party quotas legislative quotas or reserved seats for women in parliaments quota requirements are proliferating with regard to corporate boards where womens absence has been particularly noted countries that have implemented quotas have often seen a significant jump in the presence of women and minorities in formal politics in rwanda a gender quota instituted in the aftermath of the genocide has led to the highest rate of women in parliament in the world india also has long standing quotas for minorities scheduled castes and tribes and introduced gender quotas in local government through a constitutional amendment in with demonstrated effects on establishing women as leaders while it is important to place women in parliamentary seats it is clearly not enough to ensure a gender perspective since a womans key identity may be to her caste class ethnic group or religion rather than to other women even when female parliamentarians promote gender issues deep seated discriminatory practices and patriarchal norms are difficult to change through top down measures alone the involvement of women in informal political activities such as social movements and grassroots organizations may be a key for change women can not only be involved but also can shape the nature of that activism and have a real impact many examples exist of women lobbying for change including changes to laws on violence against women conditions of work and other injustices womens voices may be more easily heard in the all women spaces of the womens movements and they have been effective lobbyists on the international stage yet while increasingly heard on the international stage womens voices remain quiet in the domestic realm and even when they earn an income women struggle to turn income into voice households are not always sites of solidarity but can be sites of inequality that produce and reproduce gender inequalities of power although governments seek to regulate how people live and who they live with they seem unwilling to engage with household dynamics most policies avoid dealing with mens bad behavior in the household in order to promote change there is a

washington dc world bank need to work with men and women to establish shared responsibilities and to promote womens rights in the home as well as wider society to achieve gender equality demands joined up initiatives linking economic and sexual reproductive rights ensuring women are able to make decisions in the economic and intimate realms the popular feminist magazine la boletina in nicaragua publishes articles written in a style that a woman with primary education can understand around topical economic legal political and sexual and reproductive issues it seeks to inform and educate including reporting on laws and changes to laws aims to promote women at the grassroots to claim their rights and seeks to mobilize women during elections to use their votes an important mechanism to achieve womens political participation is their mobilization at election time and their inclusion in peacebuilding for example the womens platform for peaceful elections in senegal was constituted at the beginning of to respond to the rising tensions and political violence witnessed ahead of the presidential elections arising from the a meeting of the african women of the organizations constituting the gender is my agenda campaign gimac femmes africa solidarit fas which coordinates the network set up a task force for early warning and early response composed of senegalese womens organizations partner international organizations and women leaders from neighboring countries to launch a strong initiative of women for peace before during and after the presidential elections in senegal it is common in societies in transition to enlist foreign observers who can guarantee the free and fair nature of elections however the womens platform for peaceful elections conducted this role itself by getting trained women to act as observers across regions of senegal the capacity building also tackled journalists who alongside observers could report on any incidents of violence or intimidation and could collect gender sensitive information on the elections in keeping with the need to spread such good practice through the available technology the platform has also encompassed the establishment of an online platform of the community of practice on conflict prevention creating pan african access to these issues as a way to enhance the promotion of gender equality and womens empowerment they also established a situation room a non partisan space where women work together to foster peaceful co existence ensuring media messages on gender peace and security during and after the electoral process advocating for free fair peaceful and transparent elections and encouraging the active participation of women in democratic processes in africa the situation room acted as a hub for coordination and command for the entire electoral process including providing detailed analyses of the processes and identifying the need for real time reaction the impact of such a movement has been significant in bringing womens voices to the negotiating table at important transitional moments as is worthy of replication across the world valuing social cohesion and diversity inequalities are at the basis of social exclusion to ensure an inclusive society involves actively working to provide marginalized individuals with the opportunities to improve their wellbeing and voice and to ensure the collective rights of groups who have been discriminated against many developing countries have worked on unpicking persistent inequalities usually through the constitution for example china has sought to create administrative mechanisms to enable the ascent from poverty for millions of communities through a series of affirmative action and policy changes in education political governance and linguistic rights through affirmative action measures embedded in administrative laws that stem from basic constitutional guarantees of equality india has sought to challenge culturally ingrained inequalities underpinning caste based discrimination new zealand has worked to establish processes undoing historical violations that placed the maori in a subjugated position to the parekha settlers and institute remedies that challenge inequalities lebanon has attempted to create administrative processes to calibrate christian and muslim influences through consociationalism a form of power sharing while underscoring the need for such divisions to disappear over time iraq emerging from the shadow of oppression and conflict has sought to create mechanisms to accommodate kurdish ambitions african states such as uganda and kenya are engaged in detailed discussions concerning the efficacy of land tenure systems and south africa has demonstrated that socio economic rights can be made justiciable through for example access to anti retroviral drugs colombia has led the way in recognizing indigenous rights with echoes in mexico and bolivia while brazil has sought mechanisms to put the bolsa familia scheme on a firm legal footing all these mechanisms ought to be studied and where suitable and culturally appropriate ought to be solutions to enable more inclusive societies engaging other key actors traditional donors have a role to play in the post agenda including providing financing for development but new countries are becoming donorswhile other options need to be explored states need to take responsibility for their own social development one interesting example of an effort to re embed macroeconomics into social policy are gender budgets ngos in the uk and south africa have generated budgets which analyze public expenditures and how these are distributed keeping in view the needs of poor households and taking into consideration unpaid care work they recognize that different people have different needs in different contexts and assess whether public budgets are structured adequately to meet such differential needs they also consider the ways in which governments raise public revenue the private sector also has a role in financing development however while public private partnership models have become popular service delivery options this remains a need rather than rights based approach to social service and public sector provision the challenge is to ensure a rights approach from a profit led private sector the growing importance of the private sector will challenge traditional models of state led human rights instruments as governments will need to negotiate policies with business civil society and other stakeholders it is important to maintain that states are the principal duty bearers and remain the main providers or facilitators of the payment of remedies the dangers of privatizing some elements of basic provision is that they may then be driven solely by market forces and fail to provide basic remedies required to those in vulnerable communities nonetheless there remains a significant role for the private sector as critical bearers of duties to respect and foster human rights in their own policies and practices in creating mechanisms to consult and engage with local communities and in seeking to assist in the creation of robust mechanism that are human rights friendly it is important that emphasis is moved from the creation of non binding rules like corporate social responsibility to binding norms to regulate and control corporate activities particularly in addressing issues of gender imbalance through the provision of decent and worthwhile work for women and men in the communities in which they operate while public private partnerships may provide useful access to legal mechanisms for rights fulfillment they could not replace the need to lobby for rights to be recognized through administrative rather than judicial channels for marginalized communities organized civil society has a key role to play here similarly while the market is a way that citizens can object to activities of private enterprises and institutions that are seen to violate rights mass mobilization via consumer and social movements are not only more effective but bring the added bonus of improving social cohesion and democratic voice grassroots organizations and social movements need to be supported and their capacity built through sharing of experience across and within national boundaries civil society inputs remains crucial in ensuring that marginalized groups have a voice in the articulation of development policies post as news networks have become decentralized and as information flows have become less regulated due to advances in technology it is now possible to hear more voices in recent decades there has been increasing importance placed on listening to these voices and has resulted in significant improvements in the direction of policy as a wider range of stakeholders can bring influence to bear on policy making as the risks of exclusion of marginalized communities grow it is imperative that the mechanisms of the future provide adequate opportunities for civil society actors to engage with emerging processes measuring social inclusion and access to rights development measures have become significantly more holistic over recent years moving away from narrow definitions of income poverty to wider notions of wellbeing this ought to be advanced in the post agenda specifically in ensuring that new measures such as those that reach inside the household are reflected in data by comparison human rights metrics have been negligent in creating accurate diagnostic tools as a result criticism of human rights performance is often rhetorical and single dimensional there is a need to develop a human rights index as a diagnostic tool to enable adequate comparison of human rights within states while catering for other competing imperatives such as the opportunity cost of investing in health or other welfare such an index would show how technical support and policy change could have significant impact on human rights gender parity and social inclusion within each country conclusion stripped to basic principles the social inclusion agenda to and beyond ought to be focused on guaranteeing fundamental equalities and not merely on achieving minimal thresholds of non discrimination while the framing of certain socio economic rights may contain norms of progressive realization the duty of non discrimination as a recognized fundamental norm of law is not subject to such caveats it requires that systems treat everyone the same and is only justifiable when each individual or community starts from the same premise of equal access to opportunities and equal needs but treating those who are different as the same perpetrates new inequalities undermining the human rights project this report has emphasized the need to ensure a rights rather than service led agenda placing de facto equality at the heart of the global sustainable development planning agenda the sdgs must affirm the need to achieve gender equality social inclusion and human rights for all in terms of framing all of sdgs this requires that extra attention is paid specifically to the attainment of all targets and a careful scrutiny of all indicators for impact on vulnerable communities defined i in terms of gender ethnicity religion disability national origin sexual orientation and social or other status with further attention to women within these communities and ii to women as a category across all indicators including in terms of the right of all women to healthcare including sexual and reproductive health education and income the right to live free from violence the sustainable development solutions network sdsn engages scientists engineers business and civil society leaders and development practitioners for evidence based problem solving it promotes solutions initiatives that demonstrate the potential of technical and business innovation to support sustainable development www unsdsn org", "Planetary Boundaries": "sustainable development and planetary boundaries draft for discussion background paper for the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda prepared by the co chairs of the sustainable development solutions network thematic group on macroeconomics population dynamics and planetary boundaries johan rockstrm executive director stockholm resilience centre professor of environmental science stockholm university jeffrey d sachs director the earth institute columbia university director the sustainable development solutions network special advisor to secretary general ban ki moon on the millennium development goals with marcus c hman associate professor and senior researcher in ecology and environmental science stockholm resilience centre guido schmidt traub executive director the sustainable development solutions network march draft for discussion the world faces a serious challenge indeed one that is unique to our age developing countries rightly yearn to catch up with the living standards enjoyed in developed countries if incomes in middle and low income countries were to catch up with incomes in high income countries roughly per capita there would be a roughly fold increase in global income from trillion to trillion which would increase even further if high income countries grow further and as the world population grows and therein lies the problem if the earths natural resource base were infinite catching up by developing countries continued growth in high income countries and further global population growth would all be relatively straightforward to catch up with the rich countries the developing countries would invest in technology infrastructure and human capital especially health and education and step by step would narrow the income gap with todays high income countries that after all is the current trajectory of brazil china and india it is also the preceding path of japan and korea it is the hoped for path of africa as well yet the earths natural resource base is not infinite there is a global adding up constraint that is not evident at the country level until recently there were always under utilized primary resources on the planet for example new lands new fossil fuel reserves and newly mined groundwater moreover the worlds ecosystems could absorb the waste of human activity carbon dioxide from fossil fuels nitrogen runoff from fertilizers and even toxic pollutants dissipated by the oceans and rivers humanity could improve the productivity of hunting fishing mining logging and other harvesting activities without fear of ultimate depletion of those resources now however the planet is crowded with billion of us demanding primary resources and the earths seemingly vast limits are being hit and hit hard as a result global sustainability has become a prerequisite for human development at all scales from the local community to nations and the world economy various concepts exist to describe global environmental constraints carrying capacity sustainable consumption and production guardrails tipping points footprints safe operating space or planetary boundaries we will employ the concept of planetary boundaries rockstrm et al a which provides a powerful description of the global adding up constraints across key dimensions the concept of planetary boundaries has been developed to outline a safe operating space for humanity that carries a low likelihood of harming the life support systems on earth to such an extent that they no longer are able to support economic growth and human development as this paper explains planetary boundaries do not place a cap on human development instead they provide a safe space for innovation growth and development in the pursuit of human prosperity in an increasingly populated and wealthy world the nine planetary boundaries annex i come in three main forms boundaries defining a safe global level of depleting non renewable fossil resources such as energy coal oil gas and fossil groundwater draft for discussion boundaries defining a safe global level of using the living biosphere including exploitation of ecosystems protection of biodiversity and consuming renewable resources such as land use boundaries providing a safe global level of earths capacity to absorb and dissipate human waste flows including carbon nitrogen phosphorus and toxic chemicals such as pesticides some question the concept of planetary boundaries in particular whether we face risks of abrupt irreversible changes with potentially catastrophic implications for poverty alleviation and human development yet the scientific evidence has hardened substantially and not just in the area of climate change state of the planet declaration stockholm memorandum unep science we now have robust and rising scientific evidence that we have entered a new geological epoch the anthropocene where humanity has become a global force of change at the planetary scale crutzen for the first time we are seeing evidence of human induced changes on how the earth system operates from accelerated melting of ice sheets to shifts in rainfall patterns and the undermining of ecosystems and biodiversity these global environmental changes can undermine long term development opportunities and trigger abrupt changes for human societies e g heat waves droughts and floods rapid sea level rise pandemics and ecosystem collapse the confluence of unmet aspirations for human progress and economic development on one side and planetary boundaries on the other requires us to define a new framework for sustainable development that will permit economic and human development within the boundaries of the life support systems on earth griggs et al this paper outlines such a framework section i outlines the political and normative choices imposed by a conflict between planetary boundaries and humanitys aspiration for economic growth section ii describes a sustainable development scenario for the world and section iii discusses its practical feasibility section iv concludes with implications for the post agenda and the work of the high level panel to keep this paper as succinct as possible the annexes provide additional information and references for the interested reader i what are the implications of planetary boundaries for economic growth this question is usually answered with reference to three unattractive alternatives can economic growth and planetary boundaries be reconciled kick away the ladder the rich world is lucky to have reached a high level of income first low and middle income countries cannot grow further to ensure the world stays within planetary boundaries contract and converge rich countries need to substantially reduce their standard of living and developing countries can grow until they converge at the lower income of high income countries at that point economic growth would need to stop business as usual bau in the absence of a shared global framework individual countries fail to acknowledge planetary boundaries in national policymaking they each scramble for scarce resources fossil fuel and food prices soar and planetary boundaries draft for discussion are exceeded as the middle income countries catch up with the high income countries the weakest countries find themselves pushed out of the marketplace and fail to develop this zero sum or negative sum struggle can easily turn nasty richer countries will guard their advantage with military force if necessary annex ii describes the bau scenario in detail options and appear politically impossible in hics mics and lics alike developing countries around the world want to achieve economic progress end extreme poverty in all its forms and achieve higher per capita incomes these aspirations are right and cannot be compromised on an agenda that posits barriers to growth will not be supported by politicians and people around the world likewise it seems impossible that politicians in rich countries would ever agree to drastically lower the standard of living and why would developing countries agree to stop economic growth at a level of income that is below the income enjoyed by rich countries today we therefore believe that the bau path is the most likely scenario and that it will lead to a highly unequal world that is also unstable and often violent we know that the rich and powerful have a high tolerance for massive inequalities in wealth income and physical security yet we also believe that humanity can and should aim much higher than an open competition for increasingly scarce global resources rather than knowingly crossing the planetary boundaries the world can agree and cooperate on living within the playing field they imply by adopting improved technologies stabilizing the worlds population and protecting threatened species and ecosystems such a strategy would leave all regions of the world better off than on the bau path placing the world on such a sustainable development trajectory we believe must be a central objective of the post framework ii the sustainable development sd trajectory addresses the planetary boundaries in a new way not by an open struggle for resources nor by contraction of high income levels nor by kicking away the ladder we propose that the world should live within the planetary boundaries through the deployment of new sustainable technologies and new global rules of the game our contention is that an orderly and cooperative process will lead to dramatically improved outcomes for all parts of the world the sdsn is developing a simplified quantitative model for the bau and sustainable development trajectory which will be completed soon in its first generation preliminary results from this modeling work suggest that a sustainable development trajectory would comprise six major structural transformations to ensure that the world continues to develop economically while staying within planetary boundaries we emphasize that these transformations would only form a subset of a post agenda since they do not fully address issues such as ending extreme poverty gender equality health education and so forth annex iv and sdsn each of the transformations outlined in this section requires detailed strategies major ongoing r d efforts and continuous problem solving a lot remains unknown about how exactly these transformations might work yet we do know enough to get started with confidence that remaining issues can be resolved the sustainable development trajectory draft for discussion ii the energy transformation perhaps the most important transformation for the sustainable development trajectory is the shift towards a low carbon economy this shift must occur for two reasons first under a bau trajectory the world will likely experience a likely c increase in temperatures by the end of this century that would expose all countries to catastrophic climate change including sea level rise ocean acidification extreme storms droughts floods crop failures and the collapse of whole ecosystems world bank in the world emitted some tcoe per capita in greenhouse gases from energy use and consumption alone edgar this must come down to tcoe per capita by stern most of the reduction effort must occur in the energy sector which accounts for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions second we are depleting key fossil fuel resources notably conventional oil and gas but also coal which will drive up fossil fuel prices and make traditional means of power generation and transport fuels more expensive unconventional oil and gas will increase fossil fuel supplies at the cost of more co emissions of course but are unlikely to break the upward trend of fossil fuel costs the structural rise in fossil fuel costs and the resulting economic incentive to shift towards cleaner fuels is often under emphasized in discussions on energy and climate policy the sd trajectory embraces the high social returns to early development and deployment of renewable energies the underlying analysis is described further in annex iii an emerging though still incomplete body of research outlines the key components of the transformation to low carbon energy systems this early research underscores the economic and technological feasibility of a massive decline in carbon emissions by in high income countries williams et al ecf ekins et al the key elements of an reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by include i electrification of vehicle transport and heating cooling for buildings ii almost co free electricity generation by using a balance of renewables essentially wind solar nuclear and carbon capture storage ccs iii major energy efficiency gains iv advanced biofuels for a small but significant share of transport and v land use change and emission reduction in agriculture critically the details of such transformations including their costs need to be worked out for each region depending on renewable energy endowments legacy infrastructure population distribution etc much less is known about how these transformations can be achieved in upper middle income countries but it appears likely that their de carbonization strategies will include broadly similar elements ii the food security transformation the global demand for food will increase due to rising incomes and an additional two or three billion people to feed at the same time the worlds food supply will be under threat because of growing ecological pressures climate change will threaten large growing regions susceptible to drought floods extreme storms and temperature stress depletion of groundwater and melting of glaciers will threaten many food growing regions with increased water stress loss of biodiversity may undermine crop productivity the list of risks is long draft for discussion an important step towards meeting this challenge is to head off the worst of climate change through de carbonizing the energy system as described above climate change has already begun to destabilize the worlds food supply with massive crop failures in recent years in argentina australia china russia ukraine us and other grain exporting regions we have also seen severe droughts in highly vulnerable food importing regions like the sahel north africa and the horn of africa the resulting food crises are likely to worsen under the bau scenario yet agriculture itself needs to undergo major systems changes to meet rising demand and ensure food security rising food production must be decoupled from unsustainable utilization of water energy fertilizers chemicals and land this will require a multi faceted agro ecological intensification of food production involving at least four steps after doberman and nelson see also conway iaast wef and world bank first we must increase productivity by at least on existing crop and pasture land fao new technologies better seeds micro dosing of fertilizers precision farming no till farming drip and other precision irrigation integrated pest management etc offer ways to raise crop productivity while lowering the impact of farming on the climate and biodiversity yet food production is a highly localized activity dependent on ecology soils culture institutions and many other factors there are no one size fits all approaches to creating a sustainable food system the changeover to complex farming as we like to call it is a major transformation requiring research development agricultural extension and improved economic incentives for farmers it wont happen by itself second and closely related the intensification of agriculture must occur without significant extensification expansion of land under cultivation the resource use efficiency of agriculture water fertilizer agrochemicals must increase dramatically to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture including its substantial contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions co from land use change and energy inputs methane from animal husbandry and rice cultivation and no from fertilizer use third targeted support is needed for smallholder farmers in impoverished regions who have minimal resources but need to grapple with climate change water depletion biodiversity loss and land erosion unless smallholder farmers can become more productive to sustain their families the pressure on marginal land and biodiversity will only rise finally a food security transformation will require a drastic reduction in food waste much food is lost post harvest due to improper storage spoilage problems in transportation etc reducing food waste can dramatically increase the food supply without increasing yields or the amount of farmland used the sdsn thematic group on sustainable agriculture and food systems is preparing a detailed background brief for the hlp that will describe the food security transformation in detail and document its feasibility draft for discussion ii the urban sustainability transformation urbanization is proceeding at a very rapid pace in all developing countries between today and the share of the world population living in urban areas is expected to rise from approximately percent to around percent the scale and speed of this change is unprecedented in human history china alone is expected to add some million new urban citizens from to global investments in urban infrastructure and building are expected to rise from trillion today to more than trillion by with urban centers in emerging economies attracting the most of this investment revi and rosenzweig due to their higher population densities well managed cities can provide high quality social services infrastructure as well as environmental services to their populations they can increase per capita resource use efficiency much more easily than less densely populated areas yet these opportunities can only be seized if cities have strong and effective governments that work well with their local communities to support more energy efficient building modernized transport systems electrified vehicles mass transit bicycle paths smart power grids and efficient use of natural resources urban infrastructure investments can have a lifetime of well over years so it is vital that resource efficient investments be made soon at the same time cities must become more resilient to environmental change and disasters most of the worlds great cities are on the seacoast or river ways which makes them highly vulnerable to sea level rise storm surges and coastal pollution in recent years many of the worlds leading cities including new york beijing moscow new delhi paris and others have suffered from extraordinary environmental crises including massive storms flooding heat waves droughts and more to increase resilience cities must inter alia upgrade their infrastructure introduce zoning and siting policies to avoid floods and manage water resources and waste sustainably ii the population transformation the worlds population growth rate has slowed down significantly in recent decades but this is now occurring off a higher base the absolute number of people added each year will not fall substantially until mid century figure the figure also shows the major differences across the three fertility variants the higher the worlds population the harder it will be for the world to achieve the sd trajectory see population division a for a full discussion of why population growth needs to be slowed as much as possible hania zlotnik the author of this paper is a member of the leadership council of the sdsn draft for discussion figure un projections of the world population according to three different assumptions about future fertility population division b most of the high income world and much of the middle income world has already reached a low fertility rate notably at or below replacement levels roughly children per woman on average but fertility rates in sub saharan africa north africa and parts of the middle east remain very high sub saharan africas population is projected to rise from million in to more than billion by unless the fertility rate is reduced in a world of land scarcity water stress and climate change such dramatic increases in sub saharan africas population will likely lead to a malthusian catastrophe similar conclusions apply to the bau population trajectories in many countries across north africa the middle east and central asia to head off these threats countries need to complete the job of the demographic transition through voluntary fertility reduction the young people of sub saharan africa will follow their counterparts in asia and latin america in choosing to have fewer children if they are also availed of the key reasons for fertility reduction education at least through secondary level an end to marriage for young girls access to contraception an end to taboos on family planning women empowerment and improvement in child survival the introduction of social security programs in africa e g pension schemes can also help so that children are not the main source of parents financial security for more details on the elements and feasibility of the population transformation see population division a ii the biodiversity management transformation biodiversity protection describes the slowing of species loss and the protection of habitats ecosystems and biomes all of which are under severe stress around the world since biodiversity plays a profound role in regulating earths system it must be maintained if humanity is to achieve the sd trajectory as explained in annex i the planetary boundaries framework uses species loss as indicator for biodiversity loss draft for discussion a biodiversity management transformation at global scale would comprise strategies for managing the worlds species that will operate at local and regional scales where the species live it would also include strategies for preserving the six critical biomes that constitute key global regulating systems of concern for humanity as a whole irrespective of where one lives rockstrm and klum outline six such critical biomes the polar regions the remaining tropical rainforests the ocean marine system the worlds permafrost regions temperate forests and the worlds savannahs successful strategies for biodiversity management and ecosystem preservation are complex to design and require coordinated policies over a long time frame they are also very site and context specific many operational questions remain unanswered and will require intense and continuous problem solving for each biodiversity management challenge ii the private and public governance transformation one of the most difficult but important challenges will be the governance transformation in an age of planetary boundaries public policy decisions must be made on the basis of scientific evidence environmental degradation is often aggravated by lack of transparency and accountability of local and national governments when public institutions are weak or corrupt when they do not respect the rule of law then the public goods of sound environmental management tend to be massively underprovided improving governance at local provincial and national levels is of course very complex and takes a long time a focus on planetary boundaries requires a careful look at international governance and its compatibility with achieving the sd trajectory first global problems require global institutions that are representative of the world they help govern the voting rights and shares in many international institutions reflect the world as it was after the second world war and not the world as it is today this imbalance ought to be addressed so that global institutions can speak with greater legitimacy at the same time todays emerging economies will need to take greater responsibility in the financing of these institutions and of global public goods more generally second many international environmental negotiations e g under the unfccc proceed on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed which becomes a recipe for gridlock such gridlock can be exacerbated by wto and other rules e g bilateral investment treaties that make it hard for individual countries to enact stronger environmental standards without violating these rules or without fear of competition from non compliers for example a growing number of researchers and policymakers advocate border tax adjustment tariffs as a necessary means to allow individual countries to enact bigger curbs on greenhouse gas emissions without threatening their industrial base trade and other international rules should therefore meet the additional test of whether they are constituent with moving towards an sd trajectory where this is not the draft for discussion case safeguards need to be put in place to allow individual countries to move forward while others are still dithering third multinational businesses are now the most powerful actors on the world stage with financial resources technological know how management capacity scale of operations political influence and the power of capital mobility shifting operations from high tax and high regulation regions to low tax and low regulation regions that dwarfs most or all governments yet multinational companies must also be made accountable for their actions they must be transparent not able to hide in tax havens pay their taxes use their political influence responsibly and clean up after their environmental damages according to the polluter pay principle all of this will require fundamental changes to some business models bakker and leisinger identify four steps that business must take towards the sd trajectory do no harm e g through environmental externalities and adhere to the un global compact standards for responsible behaviour integrate sustainability into core business strategies reflect sustainability challenges in long term risk assessments for every company through investors and capital markets institute better ways of measuring the value and true performance of companies by internalizing externalities examples are the e p l developed by puma integrated reporting iirc teeb for business gri and sasb pricing of externalities these are some important steps that businesses everywhere need to undertake to better align private incentives with public interest others include responsible advertising shifting the tax burden from goods to bads and responsible lobbying see for example sukhdev iii the feasibility of the sustainable development trajectory our overarching point is the following the bau trajectory is a dark threat for the world in an age of planetary boundaries todays developing countries will not be able to develop simply on the basis of the same technologies and business models as the high income world all countries will need to converge to new sustainable technologies and new rules of the game fairness and efficiency will require that all countries and regions share in the process according to global goals and standards most importantly we will need a rapid technological overhaul in all regions of the world to ensure that all countries can continue to benefit from st century technology without wrecking the planet at the same time the challenges to achieve the sd trajectory are ethical political technological and organizational the ethical challenge starts from the premise that the rich world cannot simply kick the ladder away from todays poor countries they have neither the power nor the right to do so the ethical foundation of sustainable development is convergence that all of the world should enjoy symmetrical benefits of human knowledge and technology meaning that all countries should live in roughly comparable conditions over time there should be a gradual convergence of living standards technologies and demographic patterns in the course of this century if the world needs a new low carbon energy system it is the responsibility of all draft for discussion countries rich and poor if we need to stabilize the worlds population this is also the responsibility of all countries rich and poor we therefore take convergence or alternatively the right to development as the starting point ethically and practically the political challenge is to create a new global framework both in the form of global goals and rules to avoid a scramble of all against all this will entail not only the formulation of sustainable development goals foreseen by the rio outcome document but also clear binding rules of action under environmental trade and technology treaties and agreements and as we noted part of those rules will involve the new accountability of multinational companies the main drivers of the world economy today the technological challenge is clear to shift our industrial age technologies to new information age technologies in energy food production transport finance health education and other sectors we are in the midst of an information technology revolution driven by moores law the reduction by half in the cost of processing storing and transmitting data every months the costs of processing transmitting and storing data has declined by a factor of roughly one billion since this is enabling the

much more these are the bases for the new sustainable technologies since they in general allow us to substitute bits and bytes for physical commodities such as converting books to e books malls to online shopping atms to mobile banking and a thousand other applications the sustainable development trajectory can be achieved but it is an unprecedented and massive technological and organizational challenge and time is very short the world economy is so large and dynamic growing at percent per year and therefore doubling every two decades that we are on a collision course with planetary boundaries that will require much more than weak market signals alone for the first time in human history we will have to consciously steer the direction of technological change rapidly and on a global scale that is the essence of the sd trajectory iv this paper identifies the transformations needed to ensure continued human progress for all in the age of planetary boundaries as mentioned at the outset these transformations cover only parts of a viable post agenda the sdsn draft framework document sdsn underscores that such an agenda would need to address all dimensions of sustainable development including ending extreme poverty in all its forms in summary we propose the following items for consideration by the high level panel implications for the high level panel and the post agenda the science of planetary boundaries makes clear that we are on an unsustainable trajectory the world must reject the three baseline scenarios outlined in section i kick away the ladder contract and converge business as usual bau and strive to achieve the sustainable development trajectory draft for discussion achieving the sustainable development trajectory will require an unprecedented global effort by all countries rich and poor that will only be possible under a shared global framework for sustainable development such a global framework must have the following features a provide an ethical foundation based on the principle of convergence and the right to development b tackle the six transformations outlined in section ii energy agriculture urbanization population fragile states biodiversity which will require inter alia an unprecedented mobilization of technology c address the other challenges of sustainable development including ending extreme poverty in all its forms ensuring social cohesion improving the governance of the public and private sectors and developing an effective global partnership see annex iv for a preliminary draft list of the operational

the science of planetary boundaries the planetary boundary framework below is based on a decades research suggesting a safe operating space for humanity this was brought forward as a priority in the report from the un secretary generals high level panel resilient people resilient planet uns secretary generals high level panel on global sustainability it stated that we should defend the science that shows we are destabilizing our climate and stretching planetary boundaries to a perilous degree in their report rockstrm and co workers rockstrm et al a name nine planetary boundaries these concern various global system issues including climate change biodiversity loss nitrogen and phosphorus cycles freshwater use land system change ocean acidification stratospheric ozone depletion chemical pollution and aerosol loading table planetary boundary boundaries quantified climate change biological diversity loss biogeochemical cycles global freshwater use land system change ocean acidification stratospheric ozone co concentration in the atmosphere should be limited to ppm and or a maximum change of w m in radiative forcing an annual rate of a maximum of extinctions per million species nitrogen n cycle limit industrial and agricultural fixation of n to mt n yr phosphorus p cycle annual p inflow to oceans not to exceed times the natural background weathering of p limited to km yr of consumptive use of runoff resources not more than of the ice free land surface used as cropland mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite at not less than of pre industrial levels maximum reduction in o concentration from pre industrial level of dobson units chemical pollution no boundary defined atmospheric aerosol loading no boundary defined table planetary boundaries source rockstrm et al a draft for discussion the red areas in figure show the position of each boundary the safe operating space for the boundaries are within the green area out of these nine boundaries at least three have already been passed climate change biodiversity loss and the nitrogen cycle figure planetary boundaries source rockstrm et al a climate change is the boundary that at a global level has received most attention e g ipcc it has been suggested that a safe temperature increase should be limited to c within the planetary boundary framework the level of concern relates to the source focusing on the concentration of co in the atmosphere with a precautionary approach it has been set at ppm co which is still much higher than the pre industrial atmospheric concentration of ppm notably the suggested boundary of ppm co was passed some years back and today the co level is close to ppm and increasing there are data that suggest that the planet was almost ice free until concentrations of carbon dioxide fell below ppm ppm hansen et al according to the world bank report turn down the heat world bank chances are that the increase will be even larger it should in this context be noted that climate change is not about a simple linear relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature there is more complexity than that for example as glaciers melt more heat is absorbed mostly due to changes in albedo which will worsen the situation even further with big climatic changes an increase of several degrees devastating consequences for large proportions of society will follow weather patterns as we know them will change precipitation is expected to become more variable as well as increase in many areas dry areas will not necessarily benefit on the contrary dry areas are likely to become even dryer extreme weather will follow with for example more storms and heat waves food production and water draft for discussion availability will be reduced in many areas sea level rise will have a major impact on coastal areas notably all this will be costly to society this is one of many examples of the costs involved in passing a planetary boundary according to the uk stern review on the economics of climate change acknowledging climate change and working to prevent it is an investment at its core it is about economic growth stern biodiversity is another planetary boundary of major concern that has been passed biodiversity is a measure of variation in nature the specific boundary chosen as a measure for biodiversity in the planetary boundary framework is the rate of extinction before industrialization the extinction rate was less than one species per million species each year at present more than species out of a million are going extinct each year the proposed boundary is set at species per million species per year biodiversity is the control panel for those living on earth big changes in biodiversity will have major effects on the earth system biodiversity is the natural capital we depend on to sustain ecosystem functions there are many benefits for humans that in a direct manner relate to biodiversity including clean air and water food security and health biodiversity loss comes with a price according to the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity the costs of the loss of terrestrial ecosystem services is estimated to be usd billion per year teeb notably biodiversity is not only about species numbers it also concerns variability in terms of habitats ecosystems and biomes habitat and ecosystem availability is essential for species diversity if they disappear so will species to quote the world renowned biologist e o wilson the one process that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats this is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us this can be illustrated with the highly diversified coral reef ecosystems on coral reefs a large number of fish species are only found in association with certain coral habitats hman and rajasuriya if the corals are degraded due to temperature rise as a consequence of climate change not only the corals disappear but also the fish species associated with them garpe et al biomes are ecological regions at a global scale such as tropical rainforests boreal forests taiga grasslands tundra and deserts since they are formed primarily due to variation in temperature and precipitation their distribution is mainly determined by climate and hence sensitive to climate change with increased temperatures whole biomes can start changing in character this can interact with a range of ecological components for example increased temperatures boost the outbreak of the mountain pine beetle that is devastating forests in western canada taylor et al climate affects biomes but it also works the other way around i e biomes affect climate and other processes within the earths system if biomes are altered this may change the climate in a profound manner passing thresholds and causing long term changes in this respect all biomes are important and play a role to uphold the earth system as we know it some biomes may play a more critical role in influencing climate and should be given attention accordingly forests for example affect a range of factors that relate to climate such as precipitation their importance in carbon sequestration is well known and again we can return to the example with the mountain pine beetle where the outbreak occurred the forest went from being a carbon sink to a carbon source kurz et al critical biomes should not only be characterized by the role draft for discussion they may play to uphold a stable climate it is also important to consider their sensitivity to human activities and how easily humans can change their structure and content technically speaking deforestation is easily done and it causes a major ecological change where it occurs the cycles of nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential for life on earth the availability of n and p in the biosphere has increased massively over the last decades more atmospheric n is now transformed into reactive forms than all the naturally occurring processes on land rockstrm et al b this has major environmental impacts large quantities of reactive n result in nutrient overload eutrophication in soils waterways lakes and seas it also affects the atmosphere excessive nutrients in lakes and seas cause algal blooms which may lead to oxygen depletion the usage of p is still within the boundary however the amount of n taken out from the atmosphere is beyond what would be considered a sustainable level the present amount of atmospheric n n that is removed is million tons per year the proposed boundary is set at million tons per year thus this is a boundary that has been passed by a wide margin there is an ongoing debate on the relevance of planetary boundaries and how they may be quantified the discussion will continue and other boundaries may be added or existing ones may be re defined the key point is that living on earth is dependent on a basic life support system in which the nine boundaries mentioned here play a very important role planetary boundaries define a planetary playing field that guide humanity on how to

business as usual scenario for an illustrative business as usual bau trajectory we assume the absence of a shared global framework for sustainable development and uncoordinated economic policies the bau path reflects the current fundamental drivers of global change there are eight that are of prime significance continued population growth concentrated mostly in developing countries and being especially fast in poorer countries with an acceleration of fertility decline in the high fertility countries of today the global population is projected to rise from billion in to billion in billion in and billion in the tendency on average for the economies of developing countries to grow more rapidly than those of rich countries as the developing countries close the technology gap the current global growth pattern is of per cent annual growth in high income countries compared with per cent growth in developing countries all growth is calculated in purchasing power parity adjusted units high variance in gdp growth rates among countries within both the developed and developing groups among developed countries for example southern europe is in deep economic decline while northern europe is not among developing countries most in east asia are growing rapidly while the poorer regions of africa and the middle east are in turmoil rapid but uneven development and diffusion of information technologies building on moores law intensifying environmental stresses global warming unstable precipitation loss of species habitat ocean acidification over harvesting of fauna and flora fishing poaching deforestation etc depletion of conventional oil reserves and uncertain overall reserves of other key fossil fuels coal natural gas and other minerals e g phosphates leading to high natural resource prices instability of global food supplies resulting from the imbalance of rising global food demand and a relatively static and volatile supply side social economic and political instability in major regions sahel horn of africa west asia central asia notice that the bau trajectory fails to achieve sustainable development in multiple ways some regions fail to escape extreme poverty most regions suffer from high inequality and lack of social inclusion the entire world experiences unprecedented environmental degradation climate change loss of biodiversity ocean acidification loss of habitat rising sea level that will make every country and region worse off by the diverging economic prospects and high population growth in low income countries will increase migration flows across the world if poorly managed these migration flows stand to increase social divisions and tensions without improved cooperation multinational corporations may be free to arbitrage across countries thus putting major pressure on public revenues in every country draft for discussion the reason for the poor results of the bau scenario is the failure of global cooperation around a shared framework for sustainable development a global market economy without cooperation around a shared framework is not equipped to ensure widespread use of new technologies address environmental threats especially climate change support vulnerable regions reduce inequalities between skilled and unskilled workers and provide opportunities for all children in short a bau world will not witness the broad based economic social and environmental transformations needed in every country to achieve sustainable growth with equity in error reference source not found we highlight the regions likely to suffer moderate m and high h costs in the bau trajectory given global interdependencies however all regions experience significant and avoidable costs north america latin america

scenario by region source authors estimates explanations see text h m m m m m m h h h h h h h h h m m h h h draft for discussion annex iii possible fossil fuel constraints on the bau scenario fossil fuels constitute the overwhelming share of energy resources in the world economy greater than of primary energy use their utilization continues to rise rapidly as the world economy expands there is considerable debate about the long run global supply curves for various fossil fuel energy sources this issue is of crucial significance the long term supply curve of fossil fuels will affect future growth prospects optimum investments in renewable and nuclear energy sources and prospects for co emissions in the long run the long term supply conditions differ markedly though uncertainly across the major categories of fossil fuels conventional oil non conventional oil shale oil natural gas conventional and shale gas and coal of various grades one common view is that conventional oil is becoming more scarce peak oil while the other forms of oil e g shale oil tar sands as well as gas and coal are still generally plentiful yet this conventional view may be too optimistic global energy use is now so large and is rising so rapidly that all major forms of fossil fuels may face rising real production costs during the st century the long term real price of oil is shown in figure we see that after the initial period of discovery in the s and s oil prices fell to around per barrel in us prices for roughly a century until the early s oil prices spiked fell sharply in the s and then resumed an upward trajectory in the early s they are near all time highs at the moment many economists and market experts feel that the recent rise in prices reflects long term depletion of major fields coupled with the soaring demand from china india and other emerging economies believers in peak oil argue that conventional oil production will peak very soon perhaps this decade according to the bp statistical review the current reserve production r p ratio is around years but with the global demand for oil growing rapidly and with major fields in decline that year estimate might be optimistic yes reserves surely understate the ultimate resource availability since reserves designate discovered oil that is economically recoverable with todays technologies yet demand is also soaring and depletion of existing fields is extensive the international energy agency points out that nearly two thirds of the current production of conventional crude oil equal to mbd will need to be replaced by because of depletion of existing fields iea world energy outlook this will be a very tall order draft for discussion the recent advent of shale gas and shale oil made possible by two innovations horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing hydrofracking of shale to release the oil and gas trapped in the rock has given rise to considerable industry optimism that new production can meet the rapidly growing world demand for energy putting aside considerations of co emissions for the moment yet its very easy to overstate the global significance of the new shale gas and oil consider recent estimates of shale gas reserves in the united states where production is most advanced and also globally the us energy information agency puts the proved shale gas reserves at tcf to put this in perspective this amounts to billion barrels of oil equivalent with global oil consumption of around billion barrels per year this represents around years of oil consumption this is large but not fundamentally transformative of course the total base of technically recoverable resources is still larger the us energy information agency eia puts total resources at tcf or roughly years of current oil use worldwide according to eia the total recoverable shale gas resource base might be as large as tcf which works out to about years of current global oil consumption note that while worldwide shale gas resources are obviously substantial they do not really change the fundamental reality that oil and gas resources are likely to be substantially depleted this century or outcompeted by alternatives first not all of the tcf will be economically recoverable second the eia estimate has been criticized as too large for allegedly not taking into account observed rapid declines in productivity of hydro fracked gas wells third global demand for oil and gas is rising so that shale gas must not only replace current production but also meet growing demand fourth the costs of recovering the resource base will probably rise significantly as more marginal fields are brought on line draft for discussion many observers have argued that coal resources are the ultimate backstop for the worlds fossil fuel economy coal resources are very large arguably available on a centuries long scale since coal can be converted both to gas and liquids through the fischer tropsch process coal can conceivably replace depleting oil and gas fields there are limits to this conversion of course fischer tropsch is expensive capital intensive and requires a considerable investment lead time more fundamentally though there are also significant doubts regarding the conventional estimates of plentiful coal reserves a series of recent studies have argued that there are clear signs of peak coal like peak oil albeit with the coal peak coming in the s s rather than in the next decade as with conventional oil one of the surprising features of the current scene is that china the worlds largest producer and consumer of coal became a net importer of coal in this contributed to a rise in global thermal coal prices from around per ton at the start of the s to around per ton today figure thermal coal capp price source http www infomine com investment metal prices coal all accessed on march draft for discussion annex iv possible operational priorities for a post agenda this list outlines a preliminary set of operational priorities for the post agenda identified by the members of the leadership council of the sustainable development solutions network this list may change in coming months in light of comments received on the draft framework document of the sdsn sdsn and the reports prepared by the thematic groups of the solutions networks the operational priorities could form the basis for framing post goals with quantitative targets and metrics to be added a central challenge in defining operational priorities for the post agenda is how to tackle inequality most inequality is explained by i unequal opportunities facing children according to household incomes and ii discrimination of certain groups of society the first driver of inequality is best addressed by ensuring that every child whether born to a rich or poor household has the full chance to develop his or her full physical cognitive and economic potential this requires public financing of human capital health early nutrition early childhood development primary and secondary school advanced training to ensure that children of all classes have an equal opportunity the challenge of discrimination and exclusion is best tackled through respect for and enforcement of human rights as outlined under priority see also castellino and diop ending extreme poverty extreme poverty in all its forms should be eliminated everywhere possibly backed by an expanded and extended set of mdg targets to special attention will be given to fragile regions that need international support to achieve middle income status promoting sustainable growth and wellbeing all countries have a right to development based on a global norm of convergence by all societies should be middle income or higher the measure of gdp should be improved to capture environmental losses and other pertinent non market phenomena broader measures of wellbeing should be deployed including direct measures of subjective wellbeing productive rural communities and sustainable agriculture to promote the rural economic transformation create productive healthy and resilient rural communities use improved technologies farming practices and policies to ensure higher and sustainable yields crop resilience protection of ecosystem services reduced post harvest losses and lower food waste quality education job skills and decent work the world of work is changing rapidly driven by globalization and technological changes youth in particular must be prepared for decent work in the new era through universal quality secondary education and school to work policies including vocational training early childhood education ecd will be expanded to promote equal opportunities for all children communication and information technologies can play a central role in expanding access to quality education in all areas draft for discussion gender equality personal security and human rights ensure that all people enjoy equal opportunities regardless of gender race religion etc provide personal security and freedom from all forms of violence healthy lives and sustainable fertility by children and mothers should not die of preventable and treatable causes all families should have access to reproductive health and other services needed for voluntary reductions in fertility rates to stabilize or reduce the worlds and every countrys population every country should have a healthy life expectancy of at least years by and many countries will achieve years or more this can be achieved through universal access to health services improved lifestyles and healthy diets productive inclusive and resilient cities to promote the urban economic transformation create productive healthy peaceful and resilient cities well adapted to larger populations job creation and environmental changes cities should be free of slums and debilitating living conditions averting dangerous climate change and industrial pollution decarbonize the energy system by mid century to avoid a degree celsius rise of the earths temperature through energy efficiency and the use of renewable and low carbon technologies adapt to ongoing climate changes re design industrial processes for materials efficiency recycling and safe waste management protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services address market failures that lead to environmental destruction protect all key ecosystems marine and terrestrial by ensuring sustainable practices of land use waste management water use and other practices good governance global partnership and ensuring the benefits of technology promote transparency accountability and good governance for public actors local governments municipalities national governments international organizations business civil society academia and the research community ensure an effective international partnership on the basis of a graduated set of global rights and responsibilities the rules of the international system are made consistent with the trajectory for convergence and sustainable development key sustainable technologies should be promoted for early stage development and for broad global diffusion especially to ensure the interests of low income countries", "Natural Resource Management": "why good governance of land and tenure security need to be part of the sustainable development goal framework note by the columbia center on sustainable investment and the sdsn thematic group on the good governance of extractive and land resources revised may incorporating good governance of land and tenure security in the sustainable development goal sdg framework would support the protection of a range of tenure rights hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers pastoralists forest dwellers and fisherfolk rely on land forest and water resources yet many have insecure tenure rights and are vulnerable to displacement and loss of livelihood including the issues of land governance and secure tenure would encourage governments to work proactively to ensure that tenure protections are increased in accordance with national sdgs promote poverty reduction in rural areas land is integral to livelihood strategies tenure security helps ensure that women and men can access the natural resources they need to grow food or otherwise earn a living encourages productivity enhancing investments and creates opportunities for local communities to directly manage and benefit from those resources tenure security can also enable women and men to use their land as collateral in order to access other opportunities since nearly percent of the worlds poorest people live in rural areas in developing countries incorporating land governance and secure land tenure in the sdg framework would promote efforts that are vitally important for poverty reduction in line with the sdsn proposed goals and strengthen food security good governance of land helps realize food security at both a household and a global level for rural households tenure security is often the crucial link to sustained food security and the right to food at a global level good land governance can contribute to the sustainable and strategic use of land for agricultural production contributing to long term global food supply including land governance and secure land tenure would assist government efforts to achieve food security in line with the sdsn proposed goal empower women women produce an estimated of food in developing countries yet they rarely have secure land rights improving womens access to land and securing their tenure rights empower women to meet their needs and invest in their children doing so is also vital to achieving better food security health and education outcomes in rural areas incorporating land governance and secure land tenure would encourage governments to ensure that efforts to improve tenure security focus in particular on women in line with sdsn proposed goal reduce resource conflicts tenure insecurity can lead to resource conflicts climate variations threaten to exacerbate such conflicts good governance of land can help address potential conflicts before they occur and can provide avenues of redress after formerly the vale columbia center on sustainable international investment conflicts arise including land governance and secure land tenure would focus critical attention on managing land resources to reduce and address resource conflicts encourage responsible use and management of natural resources ensuring that natural resources are used responsibly is essential for sustainable development land governance frameworks assist governments to manage natural resources responsibly in addition tenure security encourages women and men to use resources more sustainably incorporating land governance and secure land tenure would promote the responsible management of land and other natural resources in line with sdsn proposed goal help alleviate the impacts of increasing commercial pressures on land land is both a natural resource that attracts investment itself and one that is significantly affected by other natural resource projects such as those in the extractive industries commercial pressures on land have been growing steadily with significant implications for individuals who depend on land but lack tenure security to defend their rights and access to such land these increased pressures combined with weak land governance can fuel conflict and human rights violations exacerbate poverty and otherwise negatively affect sustainable development goals including land governance and secure land tenure would help governments address these concerns through explicit safeguards that protect vulnerable land users for these reasons we recommend the inclusion of the following indicators on land and tenure security as part of the proposed sdsn indicator framework target c ensure universal access in rural areas to basic resources and infrastructure services land water sanitation markets mobile and broadband communication agricultural inputs and advisory services indicator percentage of women and men in rural areas with secure rights to land measured by i percentage with documented rights to land and ii percentage who do not fear arbitrary dispossession of land target b ensure universal access to a secure and affordable built environment and basic urban services including housing water sanitation and waste management low carbon energy and transport and mobile and broadband communication indicator percentage of women and men in urban areas with security of tenure measured by i percentage with documented rights to housing and ii percentage who do not fear arbitrary eviction this proposed indicator comprises two complementary components documentation and perception which provide critical information on tenure security in addition they both highlight outcomes and on the ground realities the proposed focus on documented rights is flexible enough to cover a range of tenure rights in different country contexts because documentation alone while important is often not sufficient to gauge true tenure security the perception measure provides valuable complementary information in addition the perception measure may facilitate more useful comparisons across countries this proposed indicator is not yet measured or calculated in a systematic way so there is a need to develop this for future sdg monitoring see sustainable development

oppor tunity to eradicate poverty and hunger and to make agriculture and food systems more sustainable this opportunity must not be missed for global agri culture systems to produce enough food to feed nine or ten billion people by there will have to be a shift in consumer and producer behavior and a structural change toward leveraging more sophisti cated technologies information and knowledge management systems and policies that promote market based incentives for growth the to period must become a period of serious transition toward food systems that operate on the principle of sustainable agricultural intensi fication sai concerted coordinated action is needed to make the path toward greater food and nutrition security the new global standard rather than the exception structured assessments for local solutions while the high level sustainable development goals for the post era will galvanize the global community to work towards shared goals each country and locality must choose its own agri cultural transformation path that is scalable and measurable at all levels national and local govern ments need to take the lead in designing and implementing roadmaps and business plans for development that are goal oriented and approp riately account for priorities feasibility and costs a structured assessment to develop such a plan typically includes five steps background analysis of past trends and future projections definition of key problems and opportunities assessment of different technology and policy options estimation of out comes and effects and modeling of impacts on development goals and targets including the costs and benefits across sectors large farms for both such an assessment should be used to devise strategies that produce substantial surpluses and small farms that support the livelihoods of millions of rural people two primary factors that will shape tailored solutions for future agricultural development are resource endowment and access to markets see figure generally countries need to move away from basing agricultural planning on subjective and theoretically instead basing decisions on a thorough understanding of the socioeconomic and biophysical factors that drive the needs of farmers agribusinesses small entre preneurs consumers and many other actors important factors figure different solutions will be required for large and small farms with varying access to resources and markets guiding principles for implementing sai although the pathways toward achieving more sustainable

available at unsdsn org thematicgroups tg tradeoffs between viable options the sustainable development of agriculture a policy and investment priority moreover though there will be for sai agricultural productivity growth in staple food crops cannot be compromised as it is essential to eradicate poverty and hunger sai is an ongoing iterative process that requires the increasing engagement of civil society as well as public and private sector stakeholders all stake holders must be willing to take many small steps and continue learning and changing their behavior countries should expect to constantly adjust poli cies to take advantage of new technologies and create incentives for farmers technology develop ers and the investment community to develop new tools and solutions for sai while all opportunities for information and technology sharing among countries and regions should be encouraged ulti mately these tools and solutions must be locally tailored and context specific in particular the domestic private sector composed of millions of farmers and other local businesses is by far the largest investor in agriculture programs and policies should encourage business develop ment and public private partnerships so that farm ing and agribusinesses can provide even more social and economic development opportunities for rural communities there must also be greater equity in access to land inputs and markets especially for women and youth who are key drivers of change multi faceted approaches are needed to approp riately and successfully respond to the diversity of farmers environments objectives constraints and incentives integrating agriculture with other sectors such as health natural resource management disaster risk reduction gender education and energy will also bring greater impact in addition accelerated progress on sai will require better support systems on the ground including more professional extension systems and greater access to mobile phone technology it will also necessitate higher coverage and quality of data on soils and weather as well as sharing of reference research and crop information biophysical eco nomic social and environmental metrics must be collected in a comprehensive reliable manner to assess different policy and technology options and evaluate the performance of policies and programs invest in increasing over time countries should adopt open data policies to generate more opportunities to share lessons learned countries must also the resilience of crop and livestock systems to potential shocks adapting agriculture systems to climate changes reducing water usage improving nutrient management and animal health and preventing further expansion of agriculture into natural eco systems perhaps most important is that small scale food production offers a direct route to ending hunger and malnutrition and reducing poverty food pro ducers especially those with land tenure are an army of potential environmental stewards who can protect natural resources and ecosystem services better than any government or large company ulti mately people are the primary agents of change farmers service providers processors marketers and other local entrepreneurs must be central to the planning of any new solution designing solutions for concrete action practical solutions for transforming global agri cultural systems must address innovation markets people and political leadership these solutions should enable concrete action that works toward meeting one or more of the targets enumerated under the sustainable development goals some solutions for early action will involve new technologies business models institutional mecha nisms and policies that can take place in any country and can be modeled elsewhere other solutions will be designed for a very specific context in response to local challenges in either case countries must be committed to implementing solu tions themselves with the support of other coun tries and international agencies and to engaging in information and technology sharing early solutions should focus on critical areas where improvements in crop livestock and fish product ivity and natural resource management can be made relatively quickly for example significant gains can be realized by providing better seeds incentivizing more efficient irrigation practices and improving nutrient management equal weight should be given to solutions at the farm level and to that improve post harvest food chains landscape management those through to the consumer examples of solutions for early action include increasing access to new stress tolerant crop varieties and diversifying into more nutritious staple crop foods implementing new models of agricultural extension promoting better nutrient management environmental stewardship and integrated increasing access to micro irrigation for smallholder farmers strengthening livestock markets promoting vacc inations and doubling animal productivity imple menting climate smart agriculture increasing resilience to pests and diseases bringing inno vative technologies to smallholder farmers to increase crop value reduce post harvest losses and improve food safety designing new business models for smallholder farming and marketing and developing digital technologies for agricult ural data collection and monitoring policy requirements for successful sai while new technologies are important policy and institutional reforms are equally necessary to align the incentives of producers and consumers and thereby drive the transformation of agriculture and food systems toward greater sustainability trans parency inclusiveness of all stakeholders rigorous monitoring regular review and continuous adapta tion to changing contexts will be key to the success of policies and of operational targets sharing policy experiences and aligning relevant policies across countries and regions will also help overcome barriers to developing and adopting new techno logies critical policy areas to address include agricultural trade and market access agricultural financing food processing and safety consumer behavior agriculture inputs and subsidies land tenure water rights and use access to knowledge and techno logy rural labor agricultural research and extension systems protection and use of ecosystems gender equity rural education and health where the poorest households spend a large share of their income on food additional attention should be paid to stabilizing food prices and establishing or reinforcing social safety nets some countries will require substantial reforms in many areas infrastructure and is another regulation important part of good governance but it should be focused on specific areas such as protecting the poor ensuring food safety or protecting vulnerable natural resources like forests water and fish stocks investing in long term change science techno logy people accelerating the rate of progress in achieving sai will require large sustained investments in two major areas agricultural research with potentially high payoffs and capacity building of national agricultural research systems the rates of return on investments in agricultural research and development are high in both developed and developing countries spillover of innovations across countries is substantial and such investments often have large long lasting cross sectoral growth benefits therefore invest ments in public agricultural research should be doubled within the next ten years and decisions should be made based on long term and strategic thinking although private sector funding for r d has been rising substantially public sector funding must not be compromised as it allows for increases in both basic and applied research and ensures wide equal access to intellectual property while international donors should be encouraged to invest more in both international and national agricultural r d systems most low to middle income countr ies should aim to spend at least one percent of their agricultural gdp on public agricultural r d private sector engagement in r d can also be stimulated through results based financial incen tives that reward the creation and adoption of succ essful agricultural innovations another important piece is removing barriers to innovation such as a lack of recognition of intellectual property rights that slow down the time or increase the cost of bringing a new technology to the market another essential piece is investing in creating and retaining a new generation of agricultural scientists and professionals especially women to develop new technologies make sure they meet farmers and business needs and turn them into applied tools strong role of private sector and governments strong political will is needed to implement a more coordinated and business approach to sai one major challenge will be the alignment of many different actors to ensure that strategic planning translates into real outputs to improve food security and nutrition for the rural and urban poor currently while there are many stakeholders across sectors with common goals for agricultural development there is relatively little coordination among them in most developing countries innovation platforms have shown some success in fostering linkages between many actors to contri bute to local innovation and stronger value chains the range of actors with whom to coordinate includes national and local governments agri cultural research and extension systems univer sities civil society organizations businesses and industry associations united nations organizations global and regional food and nutrition initiatives business led development initiatives donors international agricultural research centers and other global and regional organizations partner mapping will be essential to leverage potential coordination and reduce duplication of services countries and international donors can also encourage and enable private sector investment in farming and food systems by strengthening infrastructure providing security

thematic group sustainable agriculture and food systems over the course of the next two years countries will define the sustainable development goals sdgs targets and indicators that will set global national and local aspirations for improving human well being an indicator is a quantitative metric to track progress towards achieving an sdg target often multiple indicators are used for each target the purpose of sdg is twofold most importantly an indicator should be a management tool to help countries to stay on track to achieve the sdgs second an indicator is a report card to measure progress and ensure the accountability of governments to their citizens indicators without clear metrics through which to measure progress against the goals and without accurate consistent and continuous data across both time and space sustainable development will remain an amorphous goal metrics are needed to set base lines against which to measure progress track and predict socioeconomic nutritional and ecological change understand constraints to sustainable development work successfully with public private and ngo partners and identify appropriate policy measures principles for good metrics for agriculture there are several key considerations in choosing metrics to monitor progress toward sustainable agricultural development primarily metrics must be well defined meaningful measurable motivational and easy to understand and communicate to all stakeholders including farmers policymakers busi ness executives and consumers a minimum set of universal indicators will provide broad general information to be supplemented with metrics that are tailored to national and local challenges because a central objective of sustainable development is to ensure social inclu sion metrics should also be disaggregated accor ding to gender geography socioeconomic status disability ethnicity age and other dimensions wherever possible there are infinite ways to measure progress toward sustainable development therefore there must be a conscious limiting of the number of metrics indi cators should be chosen that are associated with well tested methodologies and guidelines proxies can be used that cover several areas of interest simultaneously moreover there will be trade offs between metrics in terms of precision scale and cost that will require a clear vision of measurement objectives at the start countries must be empowered and enabled to develop their own metrics and to collect and inter pret their own data moreover engaging those who will ultimately use this data from the beginning will increase the chance of success metrics and the ways they are monitored and modeled can and should change over time as the relevant questions and challenges evolve at the same time metrics should make use of international and national data that is already available where appropriate major data and data access gaps many information gaps hamper the ability to assess the progress of sustainable agricultural develop ment including insufficient data inconsistent guide lines for measuring metrics weaknesses in predict ive models and a lack of investment in new tech nologies for monitoring systems one major issue is how often data is collected and at what scale average or aggregate national data that are years old do not improve targeting of policy decisions and the thematic group is co chaired by achim dobermann and rebecca nelson manager lauren barredo editorial consultant molly slotznick more information and full list of members available at unsdsn org thematicgroups tg to include investments in the areas where they are most needed another issue is that while more and more actors governments international and regional organizations agricultural research centers private companies etc are collecting data there is often little coordination of activities or data sharing many currently used metrics and indicators are inadequate or conflict with each other this obscures the ability of these metrics to inform clear paths of action for policymakers and practitioners there are inherent uncertainties in estimating and sometimes different definitions of even basic measurements and models of crop yields preva lence and patterns of extreme poverty and food and nutrition insecurity and the environmental impact of agriculture therefore misrepresentations and dis tortions of the current state of affairs in agriculture and food systems are common for example aggregate national data on agricultural production land use food supplies and poverty rates typically fail income distribution agricultural waste seasonal changes in production and con sumption exogenous shocks from weather or conflict and market and climate uncertainties statistical capacities in many sub saharan africa countries are particularly dire moreover there are large uncertainties around societal characteristics impact agricultural systems these include future population growth massive urbanization that reduces the availability of agricultural land the numbers and locations of net producers and net consumers and changes in diet preferences as social structures shift for example we do not know whether the worlds population will be nine or ten billion by but an extra one billion people has huge implications for additional food needs on the demand side policymakers need cross sectional information that includes comparisons between different social groups regions and net producers vs net consumers information on long term trends seasonal patterns and the impact of production shocks on incomes and food con sumption and data on nutritional intake that include macro and micronutrients over time seasonal and year to year and space within and between countries on the supply side to improve market forecasts early warning systems and other solutions oriented decisions policymakers need accurate high that land degradation resolution transparent and updated information on crop and livestock production adoption of new technologies fertilizer and pesticide use availability of credit and machinery water use and efficiency labor agrochemicals diversity of crop and animal breeds trade end stocks non food uses of crops food prices and postharvest food losses and waste such data is currently not available for many countries due to constraints such as lack of human resources technology and funding information is also needed on the potential and actual trajectories for agricultural land development and exploitable productivity gaps fortunately there has been some recent progress in gathering dis aggregated data for a new global yield gap atlas www yieldgap org but more needs to be done to further refine the data at local levels long term weather and soil data at high spatial resolution are among the most important for promo ting sustainable agricultural intensification sai and should be of the highest priority to those concerned with food security yet big gaps remain high quality and high resolution data on soils and nutrients affect fertilizer usage crop choice and manage ment and land development and rehabilitation strategies new systems filling data gaps like the africa soil information service www africasoils net still need more r d support appropriate business models for a more self sustained operation and greater reach to other regions of the world there is also a need for a global nutrient monitoring system to help tailor nutrient management programs for greater productivity and efficiency and to more easily make progress toward sustainable develop ment targets meanwhile long term and real time climate data and modeling at high spatial resolution is required in all major crop producing regions in order to define more appropriate and feasible local agriculture systems new data initiatives and applications of digital agriculture we need to create a whole new global information system that is built on the principle of open data sharing and real time learning to drive agricultural innovation in fact many of the real or perceived data gaps could likely be filled if existing information and methodologies were better aligned and more readily available to all recommendations for the systematic reliable collection of data with which to track progress on sustainable develop ment of agriculture and food systems will require significant investments to improve local national and global data collection and processing including in related sectors like health economics and the environment this investment should be supported by international agencies and official development assistance oda our ultimate ambition should be to monitor nearly every hectare of existing farmland within the next ten years for this to happen governments must embrace the era of digitally enabled exchange of information and learning to accelerate the pace of development democratize information and empower farmers consumers and informed choices to accomplish this countries and regions should prioritize customize and commit to implementing different digital agriculture technologies based on to make investors include geographic local relevance and feasibility to collect new data that is highly disaggregated easily sharable and more transparent to foster accountability available technologies information systems gis remote sensing global positioning systems gps and numerous internet and smart phone tools such as mobile phone applications social media and crowdsourcing strong public private partnerships will be necessarily to realize their full potential as a fundamental priority every country must maintain a regularly updated central register using baseline population and agricultural census data where applicable governments should improve their capacity to collect data at farm and village levels as such national household surveys remain essential sources of information but they should be simplified for easier more reliable data collection on issues not captured by census and administrative records surveys also need to include more detail on key aspects of market and consumer behavior examples of the applications of digital agriculture include national and sub national scorecards that track key indicators related to food and nutrition security high resolution satellite imagery to support land

sustainable development efforts families e g motech species that account for the large cultural and economic differences within countries moreover with the right technology age census data can be linked to a countrys administrative records so that each individual record is automatically updated without the need for extra surveys other useful tools include composite indices that integrate and score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems while these cannot replace the specific indicators needed to measure progress towards achieving targets and sdgs they can be valuable additional sources of information and analysis for policymakers and for education the vast amounts of data that would ideally be collected would feed into a well designed and well directed global monitoring network to track antici pate and manage changes in the biophysical economic and social components of agriculture and food systems around the world this system would allow scientists farmers and policymakers to find solutions to the most pressing problems facing food security help direct public and private invest ments in agriculture allow for aspects of agriculture and food systems to be quantified and compared across time and space and track progress toward meeting the sustainable development goals universities and international agricultural research centers are well placed to play a major role in such an effort as they have thousands of experts and thousands of partners already on the ground to collect and utilize new data there would also have to be a high level of coordination with national statistical agencies un agencies and others who collect and analyze similar data an interdisciplinary monitoring network would also provide unique exciting opportunities for students and others to learn about the science and practice of sustainable agricultural development ultimately all the sdgs should be supported by online real time place based and highly disaggre gated data a

setting specific achievable targets with evidence based indicators can help countries track their progress toward meeting the new sustainable development goals sdgs at local national regional and global levels defining goals for sustainable agriculture agriculture has the most direct impact on develop ment aims related to poverty food and nutrition security rural development natural resources and the environment but it also indirectly affects many other sectors rather than define an sdg to encompass all agriculture related issues these development aims are significant enough to merit separate specific goals or targets within goals extreme poverty and extreme hunger must be eradicated within the next generation eliminating this most basic form of human suffering is an urgent need of its own and it is also fundamental to achieving all other progress toward sustainable development moreover hunger and malnutrition fall under extreme poverty because all are challenges that affect rural and urban areas hunger is not only a food availability stunting and malnutrition are key dimensions of extreme poverty and a single poverty hunger goal ensures full continuity with the first millennium development goal eradicate extreme poverty and hunger therefore the sdsn proposes a stand alone goal end extreme poverty including hunger inclu ding key targets for agriculture sustainable

be universal comprehensive operational and easy to understand a target is a specific measurable attainable time bound outcome that contributes to the achievement of a goal it should be defined at global and national levels to reflect each countrys ambitions and capacities an indicator is a meaningful simple and quantifiable metric used to assess progress toward meeting a target it should be easily and quickly measurable and should allow for disaggregation related both of these goals include targets related to food and nutrition security as adequate and nutritious food is a universal human right particular attention is paid to the availability and quality of food during the first days of life as proper nutrition during this crucial period determines a childs mental and physical development for the rest of her life agriculture equally touches on and is influenced by each of the four dimensions of sustainable develop ment economic development social inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance indeed agriculture is intimately tied to progress in many other areas of development such as gender equality and social inclusion health climate change and energy peace and security disaster prevention and mitigation ecosystem services natural resour ces and good governance as such six of the ten sdgs proposed by the sdsn include targets and indicators to sustainable agricultural development see figure key considerations for targets and indicators goals and targets for agriculture and food systems must encourage solutions to make food production processing trade and distribution more sustainable equitable and resilient thus also contributing to proper nutrition and other outcomes they must also address the consequences of consumption in wealthier countries when resources are scarce priority must be given to the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable many of whom live in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture the sdgs set aims for yet the diversity and complexity of agriculture and food systems makes setting concrete targets for the next years challenging moreover major transformations in food systems will take time and involve many trade offs that will affect the realistic potential of product ivity and efficiency growth rates therefore the targets and aspirational outcomes proposed by the sdsn for sustainable agricultural development should be viewed as a starting point that would in indicators will require themselves represent a major welcome departure from the trajectories of the past five decades with that in mind targets should be achievable they should be specified at the country or sub national level wherever possible and they should be defined such that decision makers can be held accountable for progress made against them in most cases indicators should be outcome oriented measures of success i e tracking progress toward minimum quantitative results that could move over time according to what is acceptable and achiev able in each country these aspirational outcomes will differ among countries depending on their starting points and their chosen development path ways both indicators should be customized as much as possible so that each country can form tailored practical solutions for meeting the sdgs tracking significantly improved data collection and greater investment in monitoring agriculture and food systems at the same time the availability of reliable data will determine which indicators can be used statistical agencies should promote the use of advanced and goal

agriculture wallingford uk an barrett sdsn tg issue brief transformative changes of agriculture and food systems prepared by the thematic group sustainable agriculture and food systems it is hard to exaggerate the role that agriculture plays in human development from providing basic sustenance and nutrition to employing farmers around the world agriculture is a fundamental part of almost all societies and economies yet every year more challenges arise that make agricultures primary objective feeding the world more difficult agricultural systems must adapt even transform to meet these challenges while becoming more eco logically economically and socially sustainable this transformation is crucial for achieving many of the post sustainable development goals sdgs an agricultural transformation one third of earths land is devoted to agriculture more than any other industry yet the agricultural sector struggles to keep up with a growing global population a projected billion by and an expanding middle class who wants more food and greater dietary diversity demographic and socioeconomic trends suggest a need to increase global food production by at least by many developing countries may even have to double their food production in addition to the challenge of increased demand the future of agriculture must contend with another challenge reversing that current agricultural practices place on the environment leading land degradation water depletion pollution unbalanced nutrient cycles increased greenhouse gas emissions and threats to bio diversity climate variability and climate change are complicating factors that will likely exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition in areas already suffering from poverty and hunger maximizing agricultures potential to reduce rural poverty is another difficult challenge particularly in the pressure to farm productivity south asia and sub saharan africa where progress toward this goal has been limited farm sizes shrink as populations grow and inequalities in land tenure and access to resources are pervasive efforts to increase improve access to markets and subsidize inputs may even contribute to inequalities by favoring farmers with greater access to resources and capital reducing rural poverty requires long term agricultural and eco nomic growth that accounts for the needs of the poor including creating new job opportunities for people in rural areas societies must also leverage agriculture to meet health and nutrition goals for example through crop diversification and higher food quality more than million people are still chronically undernourished two billion people face hidden hunger micronutrient deficiencies inhibit mental and physical development stunting an irreversible form of undernutrition affects million children on the other hand overweight and obesity are growing phenomena that take huge tolls on health and societies devising long lasting solutions to these and many other challenges will require deep structural transformations in developing countries the agricultural sector must adapt new technologies and business models to increase job opportunities overcome resource constraints enable greater market participation and reduce inequalities particularly for women agriculture in developed countries must also change to address urgent issues such as unhealthy diets food waste biofuel production and policies that impact low and middle income countries these countries must take the lead in implementing higher resource efficiency food safety and

public health economic growth and prosperity social wellbeing natural resources and biodiversity in every region and in every country without new strategies commitment and coordination of the agriculture and food sector many countries will also forgo opportunities for broad based self sustaining development driven by governments and the private sector rethinking smallholder agriculture each year an additional million young people look for jobs in rural areas of south asia and sub saharan africa this presents a great opportunity for vibrant rural development these young workers can ignite the structural transformation presented above so farmers can see sustained and sustainable growth in productivity smallholder farms are a crucial part of national food systems and economies and they will play a large role in the sustainable food systems of the future however without a shift in how these farms work many rural communities will continue to be left behind unlike farmers with large holdings small that smallholder farmers holders may lack capital and other resources legal rights that allow them to invest in new technologies access to markets and access to agricultural extension services female smallholder face even greater barriers to success despite the fact that they comprise half of smallholder farmers in east and southeast asia and sub saharan africa fortun ately women are a source of great potential for the future of agriculture with access to the same inputs women often produce yields percent greater than men they must be empowered and encouraged other shifts in smallholder agriculture can also improve productivity profitability and sustainability increasing the share of rural household income that comes from non farm sources will act as an insurance policy against environmental and econ omic shocks by spreading risk and reducing reliance on one source of income ultimately reducing poverty and increasing food security one source of non farm income is small scale rural food processing plants which could also help reduce food loss and increase food quality for both safety and nutrition investments in rural infrastructure especially roads electrification and telecommunications are ess ential to increase access to markets reduce food loss and improve storage and handling good governance is key to ensuring fair access to re sources markets and new technologies strength ening farmers entrepreneurial and management skills increases farm value and reduces threats to productivity and profitability as countries urbanize and fewer people are available to work on labor intensive small farms other options include consolidating farms or farm services and increasing mechanization to improve efficiency ultimately for many farmers and their families the best way forward is to move out of farming as better opportunities arise major elements of sustainable agriculture and food systems a new global the sustainable development of agriculture and food systems is essential to increase food availability and utilization improve human health create more prosperous rural communities and mend and rejuvenate the environment solutions must address population framework for growth food consumption food production and food loss one significant element of a sustainable food system is a change toward healthier diets and less food waste and loss more people in rich and poor countries are eating greater amounts of energy dense processed and refined foods which can be detrimental to health and require more resources to produce while accounting for cultural consider ations dietary behaviors need to be reformed for both health and environmental sustainability meanwhile as much as one third of all food grown may be lost or wasted along the way from farm to fork unfortunately it is unclear how much food loss and waste can realistically be reduced and we do not know whether recovered food would reach those in need more data on food loss and waste is urgently needed to guide future action addressing the new challenges of food supply and demand will require a sustainable agricultural intensification sai in farms around the world this means producing sufficient nutritious food through higher yields rather than area expansion ensuring food is accessible to all preventing damage to figure enhancing system productivity and value is the entry point for enabling farmers to enter a virtuous circle of sustainable agricultural production and livelihood that are natural resources and biodiversity respecting and protecting the health and wellbeing of people animals and the environment and maintaining these principles now and in the future simply sai aims to reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture while meeting all its other social and economic goals it requires tailored strategies and solutions integral components of accelerating economic and social development in rural areas sai is also a core requirement for the broader implementation of a climate smart agriculture which unites the goals of the agriculture develop ment and climate change communities the practical implications of climate smart agriculture are still being debated as difficult trade offs undoubtedly exist between activities to intensify agricultural production mitigate risks and adapt to climate induced shocks diverse pathways to sustainable development transformative changes in agriculture and food systems are needed in all countries but the priorities and timing of implementation will differ according to each local agricultural economic social and cultural context every community will face different challenges and barriers to sustainable development as well as different past successes simplistic universal prescriptions or recommend dations will not work instead successful models are built on flexibility and local knowledge fortunately the principles of sai can be applied to any food production system sustainable agriculture cans be achieved for farms of different sizes and degrees of market integration and will particularly benefit resource limited smallholder farms focus on without oversimplifying action must raising resource the diversity productivity efficiency resilience to shocks value quality and the overall profitability of farming we need to provide farmers agricultural professionals agri businesses scientists and local policy makers with the necessary information resources tools and recognition as well as the space to meaningfully cooperate in short to achieve sustainable development we must accelerate the dynamic evolution of agri culture and entire food systems this is the only way rural communities will move out of perpetual poverty toward long term prosperity and the only way we will see long term stable global food and nutrition security it is also one of the few key pathways to rehabilitate the environment for a healthier planet there is no

this report shows the multi faceted contributions of the global food system to all pillars of sustainable development in the post era it recognizes the need to eradicate poverty and hunger in our generation and it also points out the importance of having an integrated agricultural and rural development goal in the sustainable development agenda the report aims to outline principles for developing more specific solutions that are adaptable to local realities perhaps the only commonality of agricultural systems worldwide is that they provide that most critical resource food beyond this agricultural systems are incredibly diverse with crops livestock climates soils tools and technology varying from country to country and even farm to farm therefore we have tried our best to avoid generic prescriptions of any kind one size fits all solutions are unlikely to work and solutions will need to be tailored to address regional and site specific barriers to sustainability this adaptation process will require the engagement of diverse stakeholders and sectors our objective is to advance the process of setting global science based goals and targets the sdgs targets indicators and solutions we propose are meant to be examples to spur further discussion they will require validation and tailoring of concrete strategies in each country we encourage all stakeholders to participate actively in further efforts to define the post agenda and in taking action to advance sustainability this report has benefitted from substantial input from many people including the members of the thematic group and hundreds of suggestions received from experts representing all sectors of agriculture and food systems the authors have inevitably brought their biases to the document and perhaps focused primarily on science and technology solutions we recognize that many other areas may not have received due attention including strategies for reforming agriculture and food systems in industrialized countries biofuels agricultural policies and trade food aid land tenure financing farm insurance alternative agriculture counterfeit farm inputs fisheries agroforestry environmental and health issues of agrochemicals and ecosystem services management to name a few to many entering a sustainable development path for agriculture and food seems like a daunting challenge we believe that it is feasible the overarching motive for this report is to encourage people to act despite the enormous challenges or as john f kennedy said by defining our goal more clearly by making it seem more manageable and less remote we can help all people to see it to draw hope from it and to move irresistibly towards it vi what are some of the tough questions that need to be addressed how can we make farming more profitable and more sustainable in our generation how can consumer behavior be changed towards healthier diets and wasting less food will aspiring consumers in asia follow the same food consumption model as in the west will china import more food and thus also water nutrients and energy from other countries how can it transform its own agriculture to produce enough food in a sustainable and safe manner how can india direct more of its economic growth towards rural development and eradicating widespread poverty and malnutrition how can africa utilize its land and water resources better what will be the role of large scale commercial agriculture development compared to smallholder production what will be the future role of latin american countries that still have arable land and water resources that could be tapped what should be produced there how how can the double poverty trap of small farms with poor soils be overcome will rural development and job creation require more consolidation of farms into greater sizes or business entities that could be more productive and sustainable how can agriculture become an attractive entrepreneurial undertaking reducing drudgery reducing unemployment and getting people women and youth in particular decent and fulfilling work how can biotechnology best contribute to future food and nutritional security and serve the needs of the poor to what extent can agroecological principles be harnessed in soil plant and pest management to substitute for and or improve the efficiency of external inputs how much can organic agriculture contribute to feeding the world where and at what cost how much can urban farming contribute to feeding the world where and at what cost how can we capitalize on the revolutions in genomics it physics biology chemistry and material sciences to take agriculture to a new level who will invest in strategic blue sky research how can countries make the best choices for a sustainable agriculture development path and what should be the role foreign aid in it how can we ensure that investments are motivated by facts and priority needs rather than political interests how should current global regional and national policies on subsidies and trade be changed to enable equitable and sustainable agricultural development how can we improve the business climate to encourage more investment and small business development what new mechanisms and incentives can be provided for public civil society and private sector actors to work more effectively together what could be new more effective models for agricultural extension what should be the future investment models for agricultural research and development do current agreements and laws on plant genetic resources and other intellectual property serve future needs how can we ensure that intellectual property is honored but also accessible to poorer countries as well as small and medium sized businesses what are the concrete targets and metrics for measuring the performance of the agriculture and food sector how can they be monitored at a disaggregated level vii summary agriculture faces many challenges making it more and more difficult to achieve its primary objective feeding the world each year population growth and changes in diet associated with rising incomes drive greater demand for food and other agricultural products while global food systems are increasingly threatened by land degradation climate change and other stressors uncertainties exist about regional and local impacts of climate change but the overall global pattern suggests that the stability of the food system will be at greater risk due to short term variability in food supply agriculture must change to meet the rising demand to contribute more effectively to the reduction of poverty and malnutrition and to become ecologically more sustainable this transformation will be crucial for achieving many of the post sustainable development goals sdgs poverty and hunger must be eradicated in our generation and should therefore be a prominent stand alone goal the majority of the worlds poor people live in rural areas and agriculture growth has proven effective in lifting rural families out of poverty and hunger managing the linkages between agriculture poverty and nutrition is critical as we look towards providing children with an opportunity to reach their full potential the new agenda should also have a goal that explicitly focuses on improving agricultural systems and addresses rural development in an integrated manner as underscored also by the interim report of the open working group food and nutrition security targets are fully embedded in these two goals the contributions of agriculture to goals on gender equality and social inclusion health climate change and energy ecosystem services and natural resources and good governance must also be recognized in specific targets and indicators for these goals sustainable agricultural intensification sai a offers workable options to eradicate poverty and hunger while improving the environmental performance of agriculture but requires transformative simultaneous interventions along the whole food chain from production to consumption it also requires unprecedented large scale behavior change by consumers as well as producers of food major elements of a sustainable development path for agriculture and food systems are shifting towards healthier diets ensuring the supply of safe nutritious food to all through increasing agricultural productivity on existing crop and pasture land and making it more resilient to climatic extremes preserving the environment through systems management principles that increase resource efficiency reduce net carbon emissions and other pollutants associated with agriculture and improve soils and conserve natural resources reducing food losses and waste new visions and business models for smallholder agriculture and rural development that create economic and job opportunities and make rural areas more attractive places to live empowering women along the value chain coherent policies at all levels that stimulate behavior change align all actors provide secure rights to land and other resources and incentivize solutions for sustainable intensification of agriculture and food systems that take advantage of rapid advances in science and technology clear goals targets and indicators that address critical areas of food production and consumption motivate people and provide a structured approach to guide countries in designing their own development paths for agriculture a sustainable agricultural intensification sai includes the application of genetic agro ecological and socioeconomic viii monitoring agriculture and food systems at unprecedented level of detail long term vision and investments in capacity building and research a key principle to recognize is that given the huge diversity of agriculture and of the starting points for change there can be no one size fits all solutions countries should follow the most suitable pathways and timelines for addressing their specific challenges through tailored sai solutions policies monitoring and other implementation mechanisms solutions are workable options that can be tailored to raising system productivity or diversity efficiency resilience value and profitability of farming including the enabling mechanisms needed within diverse local contexts advances towards sai will be most effective and durable where all stakeholders work together to bring their ideas and support to developing and implementing site specific solutions that allow for iterative continuous improvement of the world s food systems and their key components long lasting solutions will require re thinking of rural development and smallholder agriculture towards structural transformations that include and benefit the poor improved farming systems and new technologies and business models can create decent jobs allow the overcoming of resource constraints enable greater market participation and also lessen physical hardships in agriculture particularly for women and youth agriculture in industrialized countries will also need to change including changes in policies that affect many low and medium income countries high income countries will have to embark on a pathway that addresses urgent issues such as unhealthy diets food waste the right balance of food vs biofuels production and fair agricultural policies these countries will also have to lead in demonstrating how higher standards of productivity resource efficiency food safety and traceability and environmental impact can be met this can also provide important lessons for developing countries in terms of technologies and policies to consider new technologies will make it possible for sustainable agriculture to become the new global standard not the exception the main factors resisting change are political will lack of policy coherence at many levels financing governance and human behavior many of the solutions needed are known or could with wise investments become available in the next years early action is important but more support and better mechanisms are needed for long term thinking and action including strengthening public research and development r d human resources development and institutional change we propose evidence based indicators that could be applied to track progress towards meeting the new sustainable development goals sdgs and their targets at local national regional and global scales their effective use will require investing more in monitoring agriculture and food systems taking advantage of rapid advances in digital information technologies the transformation of agriculture will also require re thinking of international and national structures the global food system should morph into a true global partnership that widely shares information experiences and new technology following open access principles and practices that honor intellectual property but enable wide access and use otherwise progress in implementing sai will be slow and consequently goals and targets for sustainable development will not be met in many countries new models for implementation are needed that unlock the real potential of farmers public and private sectors in solving complex problems the private sector will be a key player in sustainable agriculture and food systems good governance will be essential including supporting farmer groups managing risks and deploying tools and accountability measures that foster greater private sector investment in agriculture but also put clear constraints on unsustainable or inequitable exploitation of land water forests and fisheries ix agriculture is at the center of sustainable development challenge domains for agriculture and food agricultureb the supplier of that basic human need nutrition is the worlds largest user of land occupying more than one third of earths terrestrial surface and also using vast amounts of water it affects our daily life in many ways both directly and indirectly humans expect agriculture to supply sufficient nutrients economically and culturally valued foods fibers and other products agriculture must also provide desirable employment and optimized land use and productivity in relation to limiting resources it must coexist with the needs of urban and natural environments landscapes and a wide range of other ecosystem services agriculture is essential for inclusive development because it produces food as well as economic wealth for many of the world s poorest people wealth that allows for improved livelihoods through better health care education infrastructure improvements and greater investment in environmentally sound practices for sub saharan africa growth generated by agriculture is eleven times more effective in reducing poverty than gdp growth in any other sectors the development of agriculture was essential for the rise and survival of early civilizations increases in the worlds population from million at the start of the industrial revolution in to just over billion today and the prospect that the human population will grow to around billion in have created new concerns about our ability to feed the world in a sustainable manner the agricultural community has had tremendous success in increasing food production over the past five decades and making food more affordable for the majority of the worlds population despite a doubling in population global production of main grains such as rice wheat and maize has roughly tripled since resulting in corresponding decreases in food prices new estimates show that investments in crop improvement that led to unprecedented yield increases during the green revolution saved an estimated million hectares of natural ecosystems from being converted to agriculture the transformation of agriculture benefited from technological innovations and inexpensive fossil fuels to raise agricultural productivity in many world regions but also left others behind particularly sub saharan africa progress has been made in reducing global hunger protein energy malnutrition from about billion people in of total population to about millionc in yet global progress in reducing hunger has varied greatly by region and has slowed since further the effects of recent food price spikes relative to household incomes and economic opportunities have not yet been fully accounted for food prices are expected to remain high and hidden hunger micronutrient deficiencies and other forms of malnutrition remain widespread or have emerged many countries particularly in sub saharan africa still face major food and distribution gaps unacceptably every day more than children die from undernutrition despite unprecedented global growth in wealth and technology about of the worlds very poor people live in rural areas and a large proportion of the poor and hungry are children and young people this figure is higher in south and southeast asia and sub saharan africa where three quarters of the poor live in rural areas the prevalence of rural poverty is a b agriculture refers broadly to the cultivation of animals plants and other life forms for the production of food fiber biofuels raw materials drugs and others purposes including aquaculture and agroforestry c fao projections this includes million people in south asia million in sub saharan africa million in eastern asia million in southeast asia and million in latin america in asia and the pacific the number of undernourished people decreased from million to million during the past two decades whereas in africa and the near east it increased from million to million data quality is uncertain for many countries challenge that can be met by improving agricultural performance improving market access and reducing the risks faced by farmers and investing in rural infrastructure and enterprise meeting world food demand conflicts with current trends of increasing competition for land water and other natural resources by non agricultural sectors and needs to be accomplished under a more extreme and also more uncertain future climate in many parts of the world for many countries coping with water scarcity and building resilienced for adaptation to climate change in the agriculture sector have become top priorities reducing agricultures environmental footprint while ensuring global food and nutritional security will be especially difficult as of the population in will live in the presently developing world including in least developed countries this is the portion of the worlds population for which economic growth will be highest and for which increasing incomes will also shift dietary patterns towards increasing demand for food this is also where there will be increased pressure on many ecosystem services especially in the tropics in the past two centuries of the worlds tropical forests of temperate forests of the savannahs and of natural grasslands have been converted to agriculture with agriculture being the major driver for deforestation worldwide leading to the large share of ghg emissions attributed to the sector crop intensification has enabled increases in food production and labor productivity without putting more land under cultivation but this often comes at a price such as land degradation through soil erosion inappropriate irrigation and land management practices loss of soil organic matter and nutrients depletion of freshwater resources pollution of waterways and marine environments through inappropriate use of nutrients and crop protection products increased greenhouse gas ghg emissions and reduction in biodiversity and ecological resilience through dependence on a reduced number of species and varieties if the environmental costs involved were properly accounted for the real costs of producing food would be much higher is it feasible to continue with a consumption model that largely treats natural resources such as soil water and air as free goods crop and animal production systems are hugely diverse a good framework is needed to identify entry points that can lead to the desired outcomes of reducing poverty improving food security from household to global scale enhancing population nutritional and health status and reducing agricultures environmental footprint such a framework must consider the trade offs and outcomes explicitly across different scales to identify entry points for action three challenge domains are identified as sustainable intensification of agricultural systems for food security with high resource use efficiency and environmental protection poverty alleviation economic and social rural development and food systems for nutritional security and better health sustainable intensification of agricultural systems for food security and environmental protection high food prices slow down economic growth after decades of decline food prices began to rise slowly in the early s and more sharply after fig since a spike in commodity prices have fluctuated reflecting a different market context for agricultural products than prevailed for the previous half century it should also be noted that the commonly used food price indices have shortcomings because they measure prices against the earning power of populations which have experienced substantial economic and income growth and thus do not represent the conditions of the poorest and most food insecure members of global society dresilience is the ability of agricultural systems and communities to recover successfully from adverse shocks through the capacity for adaptation and transformation it involves being able to adapt to a changing and increasingly unpredictable environment and the ability to learn from disturbance in agriculture a production system should be resilient and contribute to increased production of food or other products over time current us constant us x e d n i e c i r p figure global food price index current and constant us dollars source world bank commodity price data pink sheet supply and demand balances for agricultural products have become tighter global food demand will continue to increase for at least another years due to increasing population and changes of diet a rapidly expanding middle class in transition countries is expected to further increase the demand for fruits vegetables livestock products milk meat and eggs and fish but generally also for more processed packaged and branded food while economic growth will generally lead to an improvement in nutrition in low and middle income countries both rural and urban food and nutrition insecurity remain challenges because of rising numbers of people with low and unstable incomes living in settlements with inadequate infrastructure including inadequate access to food in many developing countries urban and rural households that are net buyers of food often spend half of their income on food have limited means to store it are exposed to natural disasters and disease epidemics and are also the most vulnerable to shocks it is difficult to make accurate predictions of future demand for food and other agricultural products because consumption depends on demographic trends economic growth behavioral choices and policy decisions i e to what extent countries and their citizens commit to a sustainable development path if recent trends in population and per capita wealth continue feeding a world population of about billion people in would require raising aggregate global food production by at least many developing countries may have to even double their food production to nourish their rapidly growing populations it is likely that the demand growth for cereals will be less than demand growth for food in the aggregate but one can also imagine a scenario in which both cereal and livestock production may have to double within that period if meat consumption and bioenergy use of crops accelerate under such a scenario it will be difficult to meet simultaneously the goals on eradicating poverty and hunger while also safeguarding the environment annex on the positive side annual growth in global agricultural output has remained fairly steady at to over the past five decades fig the contribution of technological change to agricultural productivity measured as total factor productivity tfp e has shown a remarkable increase from less than annual growth in the s to greater than annual growth in the decade in other words tfp growth accounted for three fourths of the total growth in global agricultural production during the past decade outpacing area expansion and input intensification as the primary source of growth in world agriculture however tfp growth has been uneven worldwide countries with strong investments in agriculture including strong research and development r d capacity e g china and brazil have demonstrated high productivity growth by contrast growth has slowed elsewhere and remains slow in many food insecure countries in sub saharan africa rate of output growth per year contribution to growth from total factor productivity input intensification irrigation area expansion s s s s s figure agricultural total factor productivity tfp has replaced resource expansion and input intensification as the primary source of growth in world agriculture the total height of the bar is the average annual gross rate in gross agricultural output over the period which is partitioned into the four components shown source fuglie et al indicators such as crop yield or partial factor productivities of land water fertilizer and labor show a less encouraging global picture declining freshwater resources rising energy prices or low efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer affect many former green revolution regions recognizing that each country has different staple crops that form the basis for food and nutritional security a major global concern is the slowing yield growth in cereal crops particularly rice and wheat that are the basis of food security in many parts of the world during the period global yield growth rates have averaged for maize for rice for wheat and for soybean which is insufficient for meeting future food demand without having to convert a lot more land into agriculture for comparison doubling yields over the next years would require annual yield growth rates of more than farm yields are approaching their economic upper limits in highly productive areas in major irrigated wheat rice and maize systems yields appear to be near of the yield potential with little evidence for having exceeded this threshold to date further genetic improvement of crop yield potential is e total factor productivity is the productivity of all inputs taken together it compares growth in all inputs land labor capital material inputs with growth in total output of crop and livestock products it is mainly a measure of technological efficiency and does not account for agricultures effects on the environment difficult and will take decades rather than years to be achieved on the other hand many improved agronomic practices can still lead to higher yields and or higher efficiencies and greater sustainability in many farming systems rainfed farmers for example appear to have relatively large yield gaps or more that persist largely for agronomic economic and social reasons there is also strong evidence for decreasing crop yield growth due to rising temperatures and uncertainty in growing season weather more broadly climate change will affect agriculture in many ways requiring substantial investments in designing and implementing climate smart food systems box box climate change and agriculture at present our world is c above pre industrial levels of the th century at current trends c warming could be reached within one generation globally warmer temperatures changes in rainfall patterns rising sea water levels increased frequency and perhaps also severity of extreme weather and ocean acidification are likely to cause greater short term variability in the food supply and have long term consequences for agriculture and food systems the potential impact is less clear at regional or national scales but the available evidence indicates that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition in the areas that already suffer most from poverty and hunger and are also most vulnerable to extreme weather at present sub saharan africa and south asia are particularly prone to productivity losses from climate change because major staples in these regions are often already grown above their optimum temperature with as much as yield loss for c of warming predicted in some locations climate change thus directly affects the food and nutrition security of millions of people potentially undermining progress towards a world without poverty and hunger it is likely that food inequalities will increase from local to global levels food access and utilization will also be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health the impact of past greenhouse gas emissions cannot be reversed in the next few decades there is need for considerable immediate investment in adaptation and mitigation actions that address climate change impacts on all dimensions of food and nutrition security each country needs to have a clear climate change strategy for agriculture including strong commitment to near term adaptation measures many technology policy and governance interventions must be integrated to move towards a climate smart agriculture csa the whole food system needs to adjust to climate change with strong attention also to trade stocks and to nutrition and social policy options despite a massive research literature much remains unknown about many direct and indirect food security impacts of climate change including human and agro ecological dimensions to enable countries to plan and act will also require significant improvements of data models and decision tools used for projecting climate change and its impact on agriculture and for supporting real time action on the ground in densely populated world regions land and water are becoming scarce resources in agriculture how much more fertile agricultural land will be lost to urbanization and industrialization in rural areas is difficult to predict it is safe to assume that those trends will continue in many countries thus increasing the pressure to produce more from the remaining land various forms of land degradation already affect about of all cultivated land and the hundreds of millions of people living there often coinciding with areas of extreme poverty soil erosion drought salinization waterlogging desertification and other forms of land degradation have spread widely in the past years particularly threatening ecosystems and agriculture in arid and semi arid environments economic losses associated with land degradation have recently been estimated at us billion per year or of total agricultural gross domestic product gdp current predictions indicate that less water may be available and more droughts may occur in the coming decades the world is currently using some cubic kilometers of fresh water per year of which goes to agriculture mostly in asia fig in dryland regions such as the middle east and northern africa water use in agriculture can reach up to of the available water considering that of world food production comes from irrigated systems on only about of the arable land area more investments in improving water productivity in existing schemes and safely expanding irrigated agriculture will be needed for long term food security but with a strong emphasis on policies and new freshwater resources technologies that ensure maximum efficiency and protect critical unsustainable depletion of aquifers has become a major concern in some of the largest food producing and consuming countries china india usa but there are also many aquifers worldwide that could still handle further expansion of irrigation during the green revolution in asia contributions from expansion of irrigated area were at least as large as those from improved varieties fertilizers and other intensification measures it is unlikely that sub saharan africa can achieve a much higher level of food security and sovereignty without more irrigated agriculture integrated solutions will need to balance the use of surface water and groundwater resources by different sectors while increasing water productivity in the whole food system for example consuming less water can also be achieved through wasting less food consuming less water intensive food and improving water use efficiency in crop livestock systems as a whole from forage production to meat consumption europe north america

phosphorus cycles are out of balance excessive or otherwise inappropriate nutrient use is causing environmental problems insufficient fertilizer availability prevent productivity increases in other regions in sub saharan africa in particular continuous cultivation without such fertilizer leads to widespread soil nutrient mining and traps people in poverty such regional imbalances and different contexts need to be addressed in defining successful strategies for better nutrient management increasing sustainability will demand a push towards both access to fertilizers and greater efficiency in nutrient use significant opportunities exist to increase nutrient use efficiency and thus also reduce ghg emissions through full life cycle approaches in the contexts of integrated use of both organic and inorganic fertilizers globalization of the food system has also created massive nutrient and virtual water flows of traded agricultural commodities across regions which also need to be considered when developing new solutions for sustainable use of nutrients and water resources the nutrients imported are commonly concentrated in cities creating waste disposal problems rather than alleviating deficiencies in rural soils some billion animals in the world utilize substantial amounts of natural resources mostly in the developing world where most of the growth of the sector will occur common global concerns about intensive livestock production include overgrazing costs and environmental consequences of global trade of feed and meat pollution due to livestock waste transmission of diseases animal welfare and large emissions of greenhouse gases particularly methane the productivity and nutritional services of extensive livestock systems will need to be boosted substantially in many regions including crop livestock systems that enable better utilization of the available resources grasslands occupy of the worlds land surface excluding antarctica and greenland and support extensive nomadic as well as in positive outcomes for grasslands the environment and households pastoral communities are intensified livestock production systems nearly billion people living on less than dollars a day in south asia and sub saharan africa keep livestock for many these animals are their most valuable asset and income source many grazing lands are in a degraded state particularly in marginal areas of developing countries affecting productivity household incomes and environmental services such as hydrology biodiversity and carbon cycles grassland management practices can be optimized to result among the most marginalized living in remote areas with poor infrastructure and communication they often lack access to markets and input supplies and are dependent on their animals to support them the development challenge for these communities is how to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience in the face of external shocks such as drought which can devastate their herds and livelihoods both short and longer term interventions are required for these areas including rangeland and herd management early warning systems social safety nets livestock insurance programs timely disaster responses better education and ensuring political stability fish are a rich and often cheap source of protein and nutrients for the poor aquacultures contribution to fish supply for human consumption will soon exceed that of wild capture fisheries aquaculture has grown at record pace in recent years and it has been a major factor in annual fish consumption reaching an average of kg per person in growth is driven by increasing demand from a growing urban middle class as well as by technological changes that have increased productivity and lowered prices and volatility however for countries most dependent on fish to meet the nutritional requirements of their population wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier particularly for the poor fao mainly relying on the opinions of regional experts estimated that about of world fish stocks were overexploited depleted or recovering in inadequate reporting in official statistics of the small scale fishing sector in developing countries likely leads to underestimates of global marine and freshwater catches others have estimated that of global stocks of over fish species are fully or over exploited although not all fisheries are in crisis securing the sustainability of global fisheries is essential and requires innovative efforts across a broad spectrum of fishery systems poverty alleviation economic and social rural development the first mdg of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger was in many ways the most ambitious and the most difficult to define in terms of implementation strategies the goal of halving the proportion of people whose income is less than a day was met five years ahead of schedule primarily due to the extraordinary economic growth rates in east and southeast asia and the associated structural transformation of those economies progress in south asia and sub saharan africa was limited and most of the billion people who remain below the poverty line live in rural areas in those two regions reducing rural poverty still remains one of the more difficult development challenges because it requires sustained socially inclusive economic growth particularly in the agricultural sector clear strategies to generate broad agricultural growth in sub saharan africa are needed farm sizes are shrinking due to population increase as well as current land tenure systems in densely populated areas while there is continued reliance on area expansion where populations are sparse reliance on market mechanisms only may contribute to inequality in rural income distribution as efforts to increase farm productivity improve access to markets and subsidize inputs may favor farmers with sufficient land and capital resources other policies can contribute to inequality by favoring those with legal tenure over those without male farmers over female ethnic majorities over minorities or nomadic peoples and farmers living closer to population centers and markets over those living in the most rural areas in south asia rural poverty tends to be concentrated in lagging areas that have not been integrated into the larger economic growth process in sub saharan africa particularly in countries that lack major mineral resources the agricultural sector is the largest employer and contributes significantly to overall economic growth between and the rural population in east asia is expected to decline by and by in south asia but is likely to increase by about in sub saharan africa annually some million young people will be looking for jobs in these rural areas although this increases the pressure on natural and social resources it is also an opportunity for vibrant rural development igniting a structural transformation towards sustained and sustainable growth in smallholder productivity in sub saharan africa remains one of the dominant development challenges into the medium term future rural households in many countries obtain half or more of their income from non farm sources facilitating the diversification of off farm income sources for rural people will play an important role in building resilience and food security for rural families policy support for the establishment of small scale food processing industries in rural areas could contribute to reduced losses increased food quality smoothing of consumption and the reduction of drudgery small farming businesses are hugely important for the sustainable food systems of the future but many of them are left behind because unlike large farms they lack land resources and other capital or have poor access to markets and functioning extension services even in many industrialized countries some to billion people live on land for which they have no legal title preventing them from obtaining credit and investing in productivity enhancing measures female smallholder farmers comprise about of smallholders in eastern and southeastern asia and sub saharan africa they typically face more challenges than their male counterparts but they represent a huge underutilized potential it has been shown that women farmers who have the same access to productive resources as men could increase yields on their farms by the trends of rapid urbanization and the vanishing rural labor pool have huge implications for the future of small holder systems in which abundant labor is needed for field work tending livestock and nutrient recycling new models for consolidation of farms or farm operations and services will be needed in many areas also to allow for greater mechanization broad investments in rural infrastructure inclusive entrepreneurship models strengthening of local capacity to customize best management practices and other social innovations are needed to transfer more value to smallholder farmers minimize risk and provide a safe operating environment for them food systems for nutritional security and better health achieving food and nutritional security requires every member of society to have access to nutritious food and the information and freedom to make appropriate choices concerning good nutrition progress has been made in reducing undernourishment underweight child stunting child mortality and micronutrient deficiencies but progress has varied among countries and setbacks are common due to volatile food prices conflicts and natural disasters currently about million people are chronically undernourished in terms of energy intake and about billion people suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies malnutritionf resulting in fetal growth restriction underweight stunting f malnutrition an imbalance between nutrient intake and nutrient needs for an active healthy life which may involve over or under nutrition by a variety of conditioning factors undernutrition insufficient nutrients for an active healthy life often observed during gestation and infancy and among adolescent girls and women whose specific nutritional needs are least likely to be met by the family diet wasting and deficiencies of vitamin a and zinc and suboptimum breastfeeding causes more than million child deaths annually or of all child deaths in stunting has surpassed underweight as the most prevalent nutritional challenge affecting million children worldwide or one in children under the age of five overcoming malnutrition during the first days of life from conception until age is among the most critical interventions needed for which agricultural strategies can provide solutions the growing new challenge is that two thirds of the world s population live in countries where overweight and obesity kill more people than underweight some billion adults and million children under the age of five are overweight including million who are obese maternal and childhood overweight and obesity are becoming an increasingly important contributor to adult obesity diabetes and non communicable diseases inequalities are increasing within countries requiring new policies to address both overweight and undernourishment at the national level in rapidly growing countries such as china or india a wealthy urban and more obese population coexists with a poor rural undernourished one multiple forms of malnutrition may occur in the same families or individuals those that are undernourished often have insufficient resources to make food choices and are often also in a situation where there are environmental disasters or social unrest and thus unable to gain access to sufficient quality food those that are overweight often have more resources but make poor food choices leading to obesity and the associated non communicable diseases which can put a very heavy load on medical and support services a new phenomenon is that people may be exposed to deficient diets in early life but are at heightened risk of becoming overweight later in life generally speaking people who are fed properly are healthier but nutritional and health linkages differ widely for example the stunting and wasting of under five children which is widespread in rural areas of south asia and sub saharan africa is an entirely different problem than the increasing obesity or concerns about food quality and safety in rapidly urbanizing populations it is broadly accepted that an adequate and balanced diet provided through effective agricultural production results in healthier children and communities the relationship between agriculture and nutritional outcomes is mediated by access to food womens and youth education cultural habits health status and the health and sanitation interventions that allow vulnerable children to take advantage of dietary improvements systematic efforts to explore these linkages are still rare and the results are not always clear needs for dietary changes for improved health and nutrition vary in most low income countries modest increases in consumption of animal source foods can contribute substantially to ensuring dietary adequacy preventing undernourishment and improving nutritional deficiencies on the other hand if high income countries continue to consume more meat and sugar and middle income countries follow a similar path health risks as well as pressure to grow more crops for animal production would increase to levels that could be difficult to manage horticulture on the other hand is likely to make a positive contribution to nutrition via income and diversified consumption in all countries agriculture health linkages also include food borne and animal transmitted diseases or water and vector borne communicable diseases related to the management of agroecosystems mycotoxins substances naturally produced by molds and microfungi that are capable of causing disease and death in humans and animalsg have emerged as a major global concern high levels of mycotoxin infections are mostly caused by stress on the plant grown in the field delayed harvest and poor storage of grains thus also resulting in negative economic impact for farmers moreover in less developed countries more g for information on mycotoxins see www knowmycotoxins com than of the infectious disease burden is due to zoonosesh and the majority of them are transmitted to people from livestock hosts through consumption of animal source foods vectors or direct contact the growing densities of human and livestock populations especially in south and east asia are increasing the probability of new zoonotic diseases agricultural intensification and or environmental change are associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment risks

poverty and being thrown back into it social economic and political stability is at risk due to large regional national and within country nutritional and food distribution gaps as well as competition for natural resources people and countries may fight over land water and some mineral nutrient resources particularly countries that do not own such resources smallholder farmers and local agricultural businesses will continue to lack access to markets and financial resources and thus are not able to overcome the poverty traps associated with small holdings and or poor soils they will be unable to benefit from new technology farming families will be left behind in the economic and social development taking place in urban areas gender asymmetry in access to assets and economic services continues farmland prices will rise making it difficult for young people to enter farming lack of roads clean water and electricity will continue to make it impossible to significantly improve the lives of the rural poor youth unemployment in rural areas will further rise more young people will leave the countryside and move to the city accelerating urbanization a less mobile aging workforce will be left behind in the villages environmental sustainability global fertilizer production will increase by another by to feed the growing population and its dietary lifestyle if not managed correctly the increase in fertilizer production may have unwanted environmental impacts faster depletion of water resources used by agriculture may lead to reduced access and or higher prices more forest wetlands and other land could be converted to agriculture further increasing greenhouse gas emissions degradation of existing agricultural land may increase further soils in developing countries would become even more depleted of carbon and nutrients particularly in sub saharan africa excessive or otherwise inappropriate use of agrochemicals in agricultural systems could cause more water pollution and loss of species diversity particularly of insects and their food webs unsustainable depletion of many fish stocks will continue declining diversity and species habitat quality in agricultural landscapes could reduce ecological resilience and increase the vulnerability of agriculture particularly in fragile environments progress in sustainability reporting and stewardship system development by a variety of stakeholders will continue but at a relatively slow pace in many countries a bau scenario would also mean a continuation of dependence on foreign aid investments in agriculture as opposed to governments and private sector making their own investments and policy reforms that create an enabling environment for broad based economic development lack of long term strategy commitment and coordination would continue to dominate investments in agricultural research and development slowing progress in much needed innovations the bau scenario is clearly not a sustainable development path because food prices would rise further poverty and hunger could not be eradicated poor food choices in both rich and poor countries would continue and environmental pollution loss of forests and biodiversity and degradation of land and other natural resources would accelerate even further many countries would not be able to achieve their economic and social development goals box box the role of the smallholder in the structural transformation of kenyan agriculture and economy kenya is poised to embark on a sustained economic growth path of at least per annum that could move it into the status of a middle income country within years the locus of the economy will shift from its agrarian roots to one that is more urbanized industrial and service based kenyan economic development faces a number of challenges many of which have their origin in the health of the smallholder farm economy kenya has rapidly urbanized from less than in the period to over at present over half of the urban population is absorbed in informal employment and settlements despite two decades of growth structural adjustment and poverty reduction plans rural poverty rates have remained consistently high at over with significant regional differences about of agricultural production comes from kenyas million smallholders yet only of them are net sellers of maize whereas of larger farms account for of maize marketable surplus farm productivity is increasing but it is not sufficient to improve incomes and in several high population density regions farm size is now limiting sustainable intensification balanced structural transformation of the economy is dependent on a number of processes driving structural change of the agricultural sector namely increasing marketable surpluses through formal supply chains rising land and labor productivity in agriculture rural livelihood specialization in which agriculture becomes the key economic activity of fewer more professionally managed farming households the development of efficient input and output markets and eventually an increasing average farm size kenyan agriculture is far from achieving these outcomes and is particularly constrained by declining farm size in many areas below an asset base that will allow a realistic pathway out of poverty at the same time smallholder farming systems themselves must intensify often with significant change in the mix of production activities farm management and improved market integration structural transformation thus involves change at three different levels namely the flow of goods labor and investment capital in the overall economy the change in markets institutions infrastructure and supply chains within the agricultural sector itself and the response at the level of the farming system as it intensifies and engages increasingly in the market although compared to the bau scenario any scenario of accelerated productivity growth would help with reducing poverty and hunger productivity and efficiency increases alone will not be sufficient to achieve all of the targets of sustainable agriculture and food systems including better environmental stewardship protection of natural resources and healthier human beings more radical transformations of food systems will be required but without neglecting the basic need for broad productivity growth as the fundamental driver for eradicating poverty and hunger towards a sustainable development path for agriculture and food systems population and income growth are the major drivers for agriculture a sustainable development path will require decisive and ultimately transformative changes of the global agriculture and food system to increase food availability and utilization improve the environment make human beings healthier and create more prosperous rural communities although opinions may differ about the specific solutions to pursue a consensus is emerging that measures to be taken must address food demand production consumption and losses management of population growth food losses and waste will be important for reducing the pressure on agricultural land water and natural ecosystems in addition to increases in agricultural productivity and efficiency and measures to protect natural resources from unsustainable exploitation degradation or pollution transformative changes of agriculture and food systems are needed in all countries but the priorities differ eradicating poverty and hunger and accelerating rural development are the highest priorities in low income countries both require broad based agricultural productivity gains more generally broad global productivity growth is important for keeping world food prices low enough to combat poverty and hunger but also to curb food and bioenergy driven expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems future growth in food production needs to be decoupled from recent trajectories of inefficient and unsustainable use of primary resources i this will require increasing the efficiency of complete food chains and changing the behavior of all actors involved including policy makers businesses consumers and farmers the consumption models that have dominated economic development in richer countries during the past five decades also need to change food safety standards need to be raised for major food production and processing chains worldwidej but also in live animal and wet food markets of many developing countries many interventions are needed but due to different starting points and many barriers that need to be overcome not all can be implemented in the same order of priority and at the same speed everywhere changing diets towards healthier less resource intensive foods and reducing food waste are likely to be difficult and uneven processes the priority on the supply side is to increase production on existing crop land this can be achieved by closing yield and efficiency gaps and where possible diversifying and increasing the number of crops grown per year as well as reducing pre and post harvest losses although there is still suitable land that can be developed for agriculture a fundamental question is how much of that land should be taken under cultivation or whether future food demand can be entirely met without bringing more land under cultivation for livestock the challenge is to increase productivity per animal through better feeding effective animal breeding and livestock health care and where possible shifting to more efficient animals such as from cattle to poultry and fish or small ruminants the transition to sustainable development pathways for agriculture will require all stakeholders in the food system to adapt and adopt state of the art knowledge and technologies and it will require trying multiple models ideological battles over whether it is right or wrong to eat meat or whether agriculture should be conventional gm or organic can lead to inconsistent and inefficient outcomes particularly when local contexts are ignored in sweeping campaign rhetoric to feed and green the world i decoupling means an increase in the use efficiency of primary resources and reduction in pollution as agricultural growth proceeds through a combination of new technologies policies and economic incentives for individuals businesses and governments j see www who int foodsafety en for an overview of the key issues and measures is driven by the interaction of demographic and economic change means to support the dynamic evolution of farming systems more strongly by providing farmers with necessary information inputs and recognition there is no revolutionary alternative proposals to transform agriculture to low input and organic systems would because of lower productivity exacerbate the global food and nutrition security challenge farms of different sizes and commercial orientation coexist in any location and further differentiation over time in terms of commercialization while many hinterland farms continue to face high transaction costs and therefore remain largely self sufficient farms closer to markets are becoming increasingly specialized and linked to agribusinesses in terms of farm size the momentum of population growth will continue to drive declining total land area per farm across africa for many more years with corresponding reduction in natural resources available per farm family the land available per farm will continue to shrink until non farm opportunities expand enough to absorb all new workers entering the labor force asia as a whole has already passed this turning point so its average farm sizes can rise compounding the opportunities afforded by increased commercialization the resulting interlinked transformations of the agrifood system from urbanization include changing diets food markets rural factor markets and agricultural technologies as well as farm size while recognizing the huge importance and potential of smallholder farming for current and future agriculture we also have to accept that for many small farmers and their families the best roadmap for development is to move out of farming non farm rural and urban employment opportunities will drive this process for those who remain in farming this will provide new opportunities to increase productivity and income and use resources more efficiently these trends have huge implications for agricultural policies rural development and research the world needs to concentrate its efforts on science based actionable solutions that are tailored to local situations and support structural transformations of the whole food system new business models for farming and new approaches for providing access to modern agricultural technology to all farms at different scales are needed to ensure a sustainable development path good governance and support mechanisms must ensure fair access to resources new markets and innovative technologies policy makers scientists agricultural professionals from all sectors and farmers need to be equipped with the right knowledge and information basic education and vocational training will play an important role it is only through education that we can provide every child the chance to escape poverty in rural areas and that we can change the behavior of food consumers towards healthier diets less food waste and a greater understanding and acceptance of agriculture and new technologies reducing food losses and waste and shifting to healthier diets healthier dietsk and less food loss and waste must be integral components of future sustainable food systems given the diversity of causes involved solutions for that need to be flexible targeted and applied in a local context with strong government leadership at all levels as well as participation by all key actors along the food chain including the food industry greater coordination among agriculture and health extension workers would be beneficial k a healthy diet provides nutrients in the proportions needed for bodily function and development with sufficient quantities of essential nutrients and limited exposure to harmful substances nutrient needs vary over time and across people and include adequate fluid and total calories protein and fats as well as a range of vitamins minerals and other micronutrients these needs can be met from a variety of plant based and animal based foods in proportions tailored to each person s activity levels and developmental circumstances urbanization the commercialization of food systems and the globalization of food trade have changed the way food is supplied and consumed the movement towards increased consumption of simple and refined carbohydrates and excessive saturated and trans fats is causing a decline of dietary diversity and health among the poor and rich alike these foods also have a higher energy intensity during production leading to increased consumption of land water energy and nutrient resources shifting to plant based protein and more diverse diets would be beneficial for human health and resource use efficiency in many regions but there are important exceptions to consider ingrained cultural patterns related to the consumption of animal products fat salt and refined foods for example necessitate a nuanced approach to the pursuit of healthier diets for example in fragile regions the most sustainable way of farming and livelihood is through grazing animals and consumption of their products hence intervention strategies need to be based on culturally variable definitions of what is considered healthy in many countries they will require focusing on inappropriate quantities and quality of our food choices compounded by other unhealthful lifestyle choices in other countries they will have to also address other issues including improving the traditional farming systems to enable healthier diets it has been estimated that on fresh weight basis as much as one third of all food grownl some billion tons per year may be lost or wasted when converted into calories this means that about one out of every four calories grown is not ultimately consumed by humans the economic value of food losses in affluent countries appears to be in the range of to of gdp but in many developing countries where food forms of gdp the food loss equates to of gdp environmentally food loss and waste inflict a host of impacts including unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and a waste of water and land resources crop losses are often associated with the earlier stages of the food chain i e pre harvest harvest and postharvest losses whereas food waste mainly occurs at the market retail and consumer ends decreases in food and nutritional quality due to poor harvest storage and processing also negatively affect the income realized by sellers and health of consumers in developing countries ineffective pest and disease management poor harvest practices poor storage facilities and inadequate infrastructure mean that large losses occur during and after harvest between farm and market in developed countries and increasingly in developing countries there are substantial losses in the processing packing and distribution stages compounded by legislated due date restrictions and also waste in the home and restaurants the latter is increasingly becoming a problem in developing countries particularly in urban areas food distribution and consumer behavior play a major role information and awareness is needed as well as better technologies to manage food marketing by how much food losses and waste can realistically be reduced remains unknown there is also no evidence that if the food loss was prevented those who need more food the most would have access to the rescued food nonetheless for the hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers who are substantially self provisioning and market their surpluses reducing their losses would increase consumption and income as a general strategy developing countries should increase their investments in reducing postharvest losses whereas developed countries should create entities devoted to reducing food waste the task of tackling the problem of food loss and waste is also bedeviled by lack of data historically given the technologies and methods available the cost of measurement has tended to exceed the benefits of obtaining those measurements fao has only recently started to assess food losses and l fao estimates global losses on fresh weight basis of about for cereals for oilseeds and pulses for root and tuber crops fruits and vegetables and for meat dairy and fish however the quality of the underlying data is generally uncertain actual losses vary widely and are likely to be lower in many food production systems waste by region and food type this work is important because once countries companies and individuals know both the extent of food waste and location in the value chain it is easier to identify and take steps to address the problem the degree of financial loss caused by food waste needs to be communicated clearly to all stakeholders including consumers the food system is unlikely to grow less complex therefore innovative new techniques and methods need to be aggressively developed to know how much food loss and waste can realistically be prevented digital technologies have many applications in postharvest loss and food waste tracking and prevention and will also serve to deepen actor and stakeholder understanding of the complex nature of the supply chain with this understanding interventions can be carefully assessed and targeted to ensure losses are prevented sustainably and effectively many successful interventions would require substantial investments in infrastructure and improved technology reductions of postharvest losses often require significant capital investment to improve storage and transportation systems however many less costly technologies can also help reduce losses at different stages of the food chain including packaging for portion control at pre consumer stage breeding crops with longer shelf life using micronutrient enriched fertilizers with boron known to prolong the shelf life of fruits and vegetables improving harvest practices and low cost drying and hermetic storage solutions producing more food through sustainable agricultural intensification a consensus is emerging that addressing the new challenges requires a sustainable agricultural intensification sai m in small and large farms throughout the world a simple operational definition of the objective of sai is to

technologies reduce the unit cost of food production as well as the ecological footprint per unit food produced they lead to a supply shift and thus reduced equilibrium market prices for commodities the reduced lower prices positively affect food and nutritional security and reduce poverty but lowered prices also reduce the profitability of expanding cultivation into marginal areas thus reducing

growing world population a healthy diet primarily through increased production growth on existing agricultural land in most low and middle income countries diversification of cropping systems and or conserving more land can only happen if yield growth in cereals and other food staples can be accelerated how fast yields need to grow depends on the overall trajectories of food demand in a country how much more land could safely be utilized for agriculture or to what extent cropping intensity on existing land can be increased food production projections by fao assume an annual global crop yield growth rate of only during to whereas arable land area would expand by more than million hectares during that period however if arable land expansion is to be halted completely global yield growth rates have to be accelerated substantially one target of sustainable agriculture should be to ensure that annual yield growth of the worlds most important staple crops rises as fast as or faster than the demand by closing existing productivity gaps and raising the yield ceiling ensuring food security in the period with minimum expansion of agriculture would require that yields of the major cereal crops increase by about each year growth in major food staples cannot be compromised but countries should also take other measures including feeding less grain to cattle or using them as biofuels and enhancing the productivity and adoption of legumes and other crops of local importance to define the right sai strategy in a country a precise understanding of yield efficiency and or product quality and value gaps i e how large they are where they occur and what their biophysical and socioeconomic causes are is needed at sub national and local levels n progress has recently been made in establishing better methodologies for yield gap analysis mapping the yield gaps of major crops at global and regional scales and understanding their different contexts although this is encouraging a lot more remains to be done to obtain a deep understanding of yield and efficiency gaps in the worlds major agricultural systems at a scale that enables people to use this knowledge for concrete action in farmers fields similar methodologies need to be applied to quantify livestock productivity gaps figure yield defining yield limiting and yield reducing factors determine the exploitable yield gaps in crop production source modified from tittonell and giller some yield gaps in food deficient regions of the world can still be exploited through relatively simple interventions such as better seed appropriate and efficient use of fertilizers and better crop soil and water management likewise low livestock productivity can be tackled through better feeding practices quantity and quality of feed improved animal health preventative measures such as vaccines better animal handling and transport and robust breeding strategies however for most of the world it is generally necessary to move towards more precise knowledge intensive forms of n many different definitions of yield gap are in use and methods for quantifying them vary widely we use a biophysical definition of crop yield gaps following a production ecology concept that focuses on yields per unit land area productive capacity and impact on the environment recognizing that productivity per person is just as critical in defining real food prices real incomes across an economy economic diversification etc agriculture and provide the technologies and incentives that make it viable for farmers to adapt and adopt them in crop production a key goal is to apply modern production ecology principles to improving the management of each and every field no matter how small or how large it is farmers and agricultural professionals must learn how varietal characteristics the environment and agronomic management determine what yield and income can be achieved at a given location fig the interplay of these factors determines both the productivity and overall efficiency of the system as well as its environmental impact yield potential is defined as the maximum yield of a crop variety when grown in environments to which it is well adapted with nutrients and water non limiting and pests and diseases effectively controlled it is primarily defined by varietal characteristics and climate mainly solar radiation and temperature regime for crops grown under rainfed conditions the amount of water available during the growing season determines the yield ceiling i e the water limited yield potential yield potential is highly variable across and within regions it is impossible for a large population of farmers to have the perfection in crop and soil management required to achieve the full yield potential and it would also not be cost effective to aim for this because yield response to inputs follows diminishing returns as average farm yields approach the yield potential average farm yields often begin to plateau when they reach about to of the yield ceiling hence a realistic goal of sai should be to move as many farmers as possible from current average yields to about of the yield potential or water limited yield potential which has been shown to be a general profitable target for the yield that can be attained with good management this requires choosing the right variety and systematically improving soil water and crop pest and disease management to adapt to the environment and close the yield gaps caused by yield limiting as well as yield reducing factors fig varieties with high yield potential enhanced tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and high nutrition and product value are a prerequisite for successful agriculture the addition of high nutritional value would contribute significantly to food and nutritional security recent advances in gene discovery biotechnology and genomics based precision breeding methods have opened up new opportunities for genetic improvement that must be fully exploited particularly those that can benefit smallholder farmers most the full potential of modern biotechnologyo for genetic improvement of plants and animals has to be harnessed faster because it is one of the key technologies that will be required for meeting multiple goals of sai including increasing productivity and protecting the environment box developing countries need a rationale debate about gm crops that thoroughly weighs the benefits and risks and leads to each country making informed decisions that are not swayed by politicized arguments dominant in europe we must also recognize however that improvement of complex traits such as yield potential or drought tolerance remains much more challenging and slow requiring long term investment and a multitude of approaches implementing sai in crop production implies taking full advantage of genetic potential by implementing good agronomic principles tailored to the local context including profitable and sustainable crop rotations and other forms of using functional diversity in time and space including intercropping where appropriate tillage cover crop and crop residue management that conserves and improves soil productivity o biotechnology in agriculture includes a range of technologies used in crop and animal breeding programs it includes conventional methods e g molecular marker assisted selection tissue culture as well as genetic engineering the latter is often referred to as genetic modification gm gmo gm food or transgenics genetic engineering involves a precise mediated transfer of one or few genes dna sequences from other organisms but it may also involve mutation or deletion of genes access to quality seed of well adapted varieties that meet local preferences or market demands planting at the right time to maximize the attainable yield maximizing the capture and efficient utilization of available water for high water productivity precise integrated use of mineral fertilizers and available organic nutrient sources to meet crop nutrient requirements with high efficiency and sustained soil quality integrated pest management strategies that biodiversity biological control and the judicious use of pesticides include host plant resistance functional harvesting at the right time optimizing recycling and use of biomass and agricultural by products including better use of crop residues for livestock feeding or other purposes with the right approach and support mechanisms agronomic interventions can lead to fast large and sustainable productivity and efficiency gains box box biotechnology as a component of sai biotechnologies such as tissue culture genomics marker assisted selection and genetic engineering can contribute to successful implementation of sai strategies in many agricultural systems worldwide to the benefit of both farmers and consumers the application of dna based technologies can improve the effectiveness of conventional crop and animal improvement programs allowing natural genetic diversity to be better understood and utilized transgenic or gm approaches may be useful when the variation available in the natural gene pool is not sufficient to overcome major constraints to crop and animal productivity improve tolerance to stresses and increase nutrition quality the available scientific evidence is clear biotechnology solutions are not necessarily more risky than conventional plant and animal breeding technologies and they can be deployed safely under regulations that detect and prevent hazards to human health and the environment as a result commercially released gm crops have sharply reduced farmers use of herbicides pesticides and fossil fuels while consumers use of ingredients derived from gm crops has been no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques in their more than years of existence gm crops have contributed positively to commercial and smallholder agriculture in all regions where they have been introduced in terms of farmers profits health and agronomic and environmental impacts as with any other new technologies farmers as well as consumers should have the right to chose from a range of available options for which the scientific community must provide evidence based unbiased information genetic engineering solutions in agriculture need to be monitored and managed well as integral components of sai strategies and with measures in place that allow the detection and prevention of any risks that may occur including legal or financial risks for farmers most of the gm solutions that have been commercialized so far have focused on single or few traits e g insect resistance bt or herbicide resistance in crops such as cotton maize soybean and canola for gm technologies to play a more significant role in ensuring food and nutrition security as well as protecting the environment more complex genetic engineering challenges will have to be tackled including drought tolerance nitrogen use efficiency and yield potential intellectual property needs to be protected but it must also be made widely available for wider utilization in breeding programs of public institutions as well as small seed companies breeding and biotechnology capacity in national programs has to be expanded greatly in most developing countries rethinking of institutional arrangements biosafety laws and variety release systems is required towards lower costs and faster approval of gm crops animals and greater participation by small companies and the public sector but without comprising safety or environmental risks lesson from successful one major is that simplistic universal prescriptions or recommendations will not work the principles of sai can be applied to any production system and its associated value chain no matter whether it is conventional organic or some other form of agriculture it can be done in farm enterprises of different sizes and degrees of market integration and will particularly benefit resource limited small farm enterprises actual crop yield water productivity and profitability are to a large extent determined by weather and the quality of soil water nutrient and crop interventions management the interactions between genotype environment and management knowledgeable farmers with access to good quality land inputs and new technologies will be more successful in exploiting the location specific yield potential than farmers who do not have these assets box success through better agronomy extension in irrigated rice systems of south america in recent years irrigated lowland rice yields have risen rapidly in some countries of south america and elsewhere at an annual growth rate four to five times the global average for example on about million hectares in southern brazil average irrigated rice yields stagnated around t ha from to but increased to t ha in recent years a similar phenomenon has occurred in uruguay where rice yields rose by from about t ha in to over t ha at present the major factors contributing to this success were strong public research and extension systems including qualified motivated extension agronomists science based production scale agronomic management principles that can be tailored to farm specific needs a participatory research and extension approach including key stakeholders and farmer to farmer extension functioning markets supply chains and local agri businesses with transparent business relationships good governance and supporting policies that avoided distortions or disincentives extension programs also reward farmers for meeting best management standards and environmental stewardship requirements which are also communicated to rice consumers through branding schemes water consumption nitrogen consumption energy consumption and methane emissions per unit food produced have all decreased agrochemical use was reduced and soil and water quality meet high standards another lesson is that sai should not aim to blindly copy natural ecosystems that have not been optimized for food feed fiber or bioenergy production instead sai can derive options from natural systems traditional systems industrial systems and alternative systems from experimentation and traditional knowledge from scientific theory and empirical observation these options need to be tailored to local conditions by well integrated research and development systems although many principles for a systematic sai approach are generic the scope for increasing eco efficiency in agriculture can vary widely box similar sai concepts can be applied to a wide range of agricultural systems livestock systems play a particularly significant role for food and nutrition security rural livelihoods and the economies of developing countries they provide nourishment for rural and urban households income and employment for producers and others working in value chains and a crucial asset and safety net for the poor increasing the productivity resource efficiency and sustainability of livestock systems includes following principles such as adopting management practices that improve animal health and welfare increasing animal productivity and efficiency through genetic improvements and better feeding including adoption of age specific balanced feed rations decreasing pollution by optimizing critical metabolic and nutrient cycles e g nitrogen phosphorus methane gas emissions improving rangeland productivity diversity and grazing management enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience adapting management practices that preserve biological diversity in livestock agroecosystems using manure within comprehensive nutrient management systems while recognizing and mitigating its associated health and contamination risks box pathways for improving eco efciency will differ among diverse cropping systems global food security requires producing the required food and ber crops concomitant with ecologically efficient use of resources this eco efficiency concept was used to diagnose the state of agricultural production in china irrigated wheatmaize double cropping systems zimbabwe rainfed maize systems and australia rainfed wheat systems more than surveyed crop yields were compared against simulated grain yields at actual levels of nitrogen n input many australian commercial wheat farmers are close to existing production frontiers and gain little additional return from increasing their n input signicant losses of n from their systems are infrequent and at low intensities relative to their level of grain production these australian farmers operate close to eco efcient frontiers with regard to n innovations in technologies and practices are essential to increasing their production without added economic or environmental risks in contrast many chinese farmers can reduce n input without sacricing production through more efcient use of their fertilizer input there are real prospects for the double cropping systems on the north china plain to achieve both production increases and reduced environmental risks zimbabwean farmers on the other hand have the opportunity for signicant production increases by both improving their technical efciency and increasing nitrogen and other inputs doing so will require improved management expertise and greater access to institutional support for addressing the higher risks that can be associated aquaculture the farmed production of fish shellfish and aquatic plants such as algae is currently among the fastest growing animal food production sectors in many developed and developing countries it will soon supply more than half of the world s seafood for human consumption continued growth in aquaculture production is likely to come from further intensification which is often accompanied by a range of resource and environmental problems novel culture systems alternative feeding strategies and species choices are among the sai strategies for such systems but policies that provide incentives for innovation and environmental improvement are equally important further important components are urban food production and delivery systems which have two facets i bringing food from peri urban and rural areas to meet the needs of urban centers and their inherent systems policies and regulations ii opportunities for producing food in the urban environment the potential for urban food production needs to be assessed realistically but there may also be important avenues for improving it within a sai context box in summary a flexible approach for sai must embrace modern science and technology and combine it with local knowledge enabling governance and business support systems to develop and implement location specific solutions in the short term there is an opportunity to address local and regional markets through incremental improvements with improved performance and the expansion of regional infrastructure and governance global markets may be accessed depending on the commodity grown and its competitiveness importantly sai requires better access to and utilization of knowledge and information by all actors along the value chain climate smart agricultural landscapes implementing sai in practice is also situated within broader concepts of a more climate smart agriculture csa uniting the agendas of the agriculture development and climate change communities historically farmers have adapted their farming systems and management practices to changing climate and variable weather this process needs to accelerate in our generation in that context csa is a continuous process of improving agriculture through innovations in policies technologies management and financing that aim to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of people food production systems and ecosystems in agricultural landscapes reduce and or remove greenhouse gases emissions where possible the concept and practical solutions for csa are still debated because the relationship between these three dimensions is poorly understood it often involves trade offs driven by different incentives by different actors why for example should a poor farmers invest in agricultural practices that may reduce ghg emissions if there are few if any immediate benefits related to his income or food security in practice many improved agricultural practices can be considered climate smart but not all may have the desirable short and long term benefits just from a plant breeding perspective there are often trade offs between yield gain and yield stability if not resilience is mitigation e g in livestock systems compatible with intensification hard choices may often have to be made on trade offs between intensification mitigation and adaptation climate smart agriculture should therefore be developed further as an implementation concept that also utilizes the sai principles stated above to bring us closer to operating within foreseeable local and planetary limits for agricultural and food systems scientifically sound indicators and metrics must be defined to guide this process box what is the potential for urban food production there are complex and often well integrated systems and processes often private sector driven that bring food to urban areas and ensure it can be reached by the urban populations through a range of traders retail markets shops and supermarkets or direct purchasing from producers or middlemen by consumers through electronic and other means for door to door delivery the need for packaging and transportation increases the carbon footprint of agricultural products and there are potential losses from poor postharvest management of perishable products where in place inflexible regulatory systems between retailers and consumers minimize risk to the consumer while creating a large amount of wastage there has always been urban food production in cities e g market gardens for perishable high value products and also for recreational or home production in gardens or through city allocated land allotments where property rights are not well established including many cities in africa and asia there has been an opportunistic incursion onto available land for production of crop and animal products and along rivers and streams most urban food production focuses on high value and perishable products such as vegetables and milk there are also opportunities for vertical production rooftop gardens and small scale crop production in cities to fill some commercial and household niches what proportion of the food for cities can be safely grown within city boundaries remains unknown and it is also uncertain how much of this is actually marketed land is expected to be in even shorter supply as urban infrastructure deepens urban crop and animal producers and consumers also need to be aware of the possibility of contamination with heavy metals pathogenic microorganisms pesticides manure and other byproducts where waters contaminated with industrial effluent and or sewage are used for irrigation new strategies and technologies for increasing vertical food production in cities are being studied however the costs of this are likely to be uncompetitive with traditional supplies from rural and peri urban sources current rates of urbanization suggest even in less developed areas that the rural population will start to decline absolutely over the period to there is likely to be land consolidation and growing labor productivity in rural based agriculture resulting in increased productivity and lowering costs it is unlikely that capital intensive urban production will have a comparative advantage over increased labor and land efficiency in rural areas but it will continue to play a local but important role in the food system incorporating adaptation and mitigation beyond achieving such climate smart objectives agricultural systems must also provide and protect a wide range of ecosystem services many need to be operated on principles of integrated landscape management while explicitly into their management objectives such landscape approaches seek to provide principles and tools for allocating and managing land to achieve social economic and environmental objectives in areas where agriculture mining and other land uses compete with environmental and biodiversity goals potential exists in many agricultural areas to realize greater efficiencies and multiple benefits through managing larger landscapes and regions examples include large scale irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems grazing reserves in a small portion of the landscape that can be accessed by livestock keepers in times of drought ecological engineering approaches for integrated pest and disease management management of invasive alien crop or animal species e g exotic weeds crop an animal diseases fish or payment for environmental services schemes promising examples have already emerged in all world regions there are many uncertainties competing demands and other factors that often require making compromises in land use and landscape management achieving multiple objectives is an ongoing process subject to negotiation learning adaptation and improvement ten principles have recently been proposed to guide the process of decision making in landscape contexts continual learning and adaptive management common concern entry point multiple scales multifunctionality multiple stakeholders negotiated and transparent change logic clarification of rights and responsibilities participatory and user friendly monitoring resilience and strengthened stakeholder capacity agriculture in the post action agenda for sustainable development general considerations directly and indirectly agriculture will contribute to achieving interrelated development outcomes such as poverty food and nutritional security economic and social development gender equality energy water climate biodiversity peace and security and disaster prevention or mitigation a framework is needed for understanding and realizing these contributions with clear goals and targets effective solutions for concrete action and indicators that allow measuring progress building on the rio outcome sustainable development is a holistic concept with four interconnected dimensions economic development including ending poverty social inclusion environmental sustainability and good governance measures taken to improve one dimension often improve others sustainable development goals sdgs for the post era and the concrete targets for these goals still need to be agreed on by the global community they will guide the publics understanding of complex sustainable development challenges inspire action promote integrated thinking and foster accountability they will be complementary to the tools of international law by providing a shared normative framework that fosters collaboration across countries each country needs to choose its own sustainable development paths with specific achievable targets at country or local level and taking into account their current positions along these paths we use the following definitions goal expresses an ambitious specific commitment lays out a single challenge with great impact should be universal comprehensive operational and easy to understand specific measurable attainable time bound sub component that contributes in a major way to achievement of the goal i e an outcome variable that is easy to understand representing one major direction of change to qualify as a target the problem must be preventable or a way out of it is found through interventions in agriculture and food systems targets should be specified at the global and national level reflecting the level of ambition of each country and the speed at which a country pursues a goal a sound measurable metric to assess whether the target is being met including detecting trends and anomalies often multiple indicators are used for this purpose indicators should be meaningful sensitive to the most critical aspects of a target reliable and doable in terms of available data and measurement protocols quickly available and easy to understand by policy makers investors and other stakeholders they should also allow for disaggregation i e targets to be measured in various dimensions such as by geography socioeconomic status gender age and ethnicity for example target indicator goals and targets for agriculture and food systems need to encourage systematic solutions for making food production processing trade and distribution more sustainable equitable and resilient thus also contributing to nutrition and other outcomes they also need to address the trade offs between consumption in wealthier countries and its potential consequences for other countries where trade offs are required in cases of scarce resources the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people must be addressed first many of whom live in rural areas and are engaged in agriculture the new sdgs and targets also need to mobilize attention and action to reverse or mitigate threats to food production from ecosystem degradation affecting landscapes and whole communities many of which cannot be overcome with improved seeds or farm level nutrient and water management solutions these offer great opportunities for collaborative action between agriculture rural development environment and education ministries and other stakeholders in the sdgs most targets should be defined as practically achievable targets for which decision makers can be held accountable recognizing the aspirations of the zero hunger challengep we aim to provide guidance on pragmatic targets indicators and approaches that could ultimately lead towards meeting that challenge we recognize that solving global problems involves many transnational issues but we propose that goals and targets should place strong emphasis on the responsibilities of countries including developed and developing countries first contours of possible post sdgs and their specific targets are emerging the un system task team on the post un development agenda provided first suggestions including a discussion of statistics and indicators for the post development agenda in its report to the un secretary general the high level panel of eminent persons on the post development agenda proposed possible sdgs with targets agriculture makes direct and indirect contributions to of the goals proposed but particularly to goal end poverty goal ensure food security and good nutrition and goal manage natural resource assets sustainably the sustainable development solutions network sdsn proposed priority development challenges addressing the four dimensions of sustainable development they are interconnected and form the basis for possible sdgs with targets designed to trigger practical solutions that countries can pursue with high priority annex we restrict our discussion to the sdgs and targets proposed by the sdsn primarily to stimulate further discussion because poverty and hunger must be eradicated in our generation a prominent stand alone goal should address that urgent need goal the global development agenda should also have a goal that explicitly focuses on improving agricultural systems and rural development in an integrated manner goal to adequately address the need for transformative changes that are required to make agriculture more productive and more sustainable as underscored by the interim report of the open working group on the sustainable development goals food and nutrition security targets are fully embedded in these two goals recognizing that adequate and nutritious food is a universal human right and all the states in the world have the responsibility to respect secure and implement this right future goals should pay extra attention to the availability and quality of food during the first days from conception until the age of two because malnutrition under the age of two is fatal for a persons development in the longer term we must also recognize and capture the contributions of agriculture to goals on gender equality and social inclusion health climate change and energy ecosystem services and natural resources and good governance the new sdg framework could more explicitly address sustainable landscape management as a goal or targets and indicators that focus on livelihood provision ecosystem services products and resource efficiency as key landscape dimensions difficulties in terms of political and administrative planning implementation and monitoring may be associated with a landscape based framework but we encourage further discussion of this likewise a holistic global framework such as faos sustainability assessment of food and agriculture safa could be applied for the assessment of sustainability along food and agriculture value chains to establish an international reference for assessing trade offs and synergies between all dimensions of sustainability elements of it could also be applied to the sdgs and their targets and indicators p aspirational goals stated for the zero hunger challenge are access to adequate food for all throughout the year zero stunted children less than years of age all food systems are sustainable increase in smallholder productivity and income and zero loss or waste of food www un org en zerohunger unless otherwise noted the targets stated are for relative to the current situation i e most targets need to be specified at country or sub national level we propose indicators that link to existing ones such as the current mdgs www un org millenniumgoals and those used by many united nations agencies and other international and national organizations including the world bank http data worldbank org but we also propose some new ones that may be needed for assessing progress in agriculture and its associated functions some indicators may also be improved towards measuring more deeply the inequality within a country and many should be disaggregated by gender both existing and new indicators will require improved data collection and other monitoring mechanisms statistical agencies should promote the use of advanced data tools including remote sensing real time monitoring with smartphones crowd sourcing gis mapping and other techniques due to the diversity and complexity of agriculture and food systems setting concrete targets for the next years is challenging the concept of planetary boundariesq is used by the sdsn for guiding the transformative changes needed for sustainable development on a global scale achieving future growth within these boundaries will require the adoption of sustainable technologies and behaviors that decouple economic growth from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption there is an ongoing debate on the relevance of planetary boundaries for agriculture and how they could be quantified for example the currently proposed planetary boundaries for nitrogen n and phosphorus p flows have been arbitrarily set do not include social dimensions and would likely lead to severe risks for ensuring global food security moreover adoption of new technologies in agriculture is a slow and uneven process which also affects what realistic growth rates for improving productivity and resource use efficiencies could be recognizing that major transformations in food systems will take time and also involve many trade offs the targets and aspirational outcomes we propose for the post period should be viewed as a starting point for example the main rationale for proposing to increase the efficiency of resources such as water nutrients and energy in agriculture and food systems by in relative to current levels see target a is that on a global scale improvements in the efficiency of these resources should at least exceed the annual rates of yield increase required during that period just achieving this would be a major welcome departure from the trajectories of the past five decades transformative changes that could lead to even greater efficiency gains will likely take more time including radical shifts in diets or major reductions of food loss or waste we suggest outcome oriented measures of success for most indicators i e numerical values in square brackets that countries could aspire to achieve for setting their own vision of success they can be viewed as minimum thresholds to aim for but require further analysis and consensus such quantitative targets will differ among countries depending on their starting points and the different transformational pathways to enter hence timelines and additional indicators could be adapted to national circumstances and countries may also use additional targets and indicators customization and disaggregation of targets and indicators form the basis for tailoring practical solutions for meeting the aggregated global sdgs chapter implementation pathways require country specific analyses and involvement by many stakeholders to exploit all opportunities and to improve metrics and data gathering processes and other tools that enhance decision making education communication and behavioral change chapter building more reliable data systems that provide timely disaggregated indicators to measure progress in all countries sub populations and at all levels local sub national q planetary boundaries define the safe operating space for humanity in the earth system climate change biodiversity loss biochemical cycles nitrogen and phosphorus loading global freshwater use land use change ocean acidification stratospheric ozone chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading national regional global will be vital for success it requires the use of innovative technologies as well as greater sustained investments in monitoring world agriculture and food systems see chapter the subsequent discussion focuses on contributions of sustainable agriculture and food systems to goals and annex agriculture also contributes to other goals such as goals and sustainable development goals targets and indicators for agriculture and food systems goal end extreme poverty including hunger end extreme poverty in all its forms mdgs including hunger child stunting malnutrition and food insecurity support highly vulnerable countries target a end absolute income poverty or less per day and hunger including achieving food security and appropriate nutrition and ending child stunting comments current mdg indicator but using the current world bank threshold for poverty i e the percentage of population living on less than a day ppp at prices the threshold to use may require further adjustment global poverty rates cannot be directly compared with national level poverty rates which are derived using country specific poverty lines estimated in local currencies multiple poverty lines can be used for further disaggregation and analysis iresearch worldbank org povcalnet similar to the current mdg indicator countries often have their own thresholds for what constitutes acceptable poverty for their citizens defined at a national or sub national level this indicator would allow countries to move the poverty line upwards over time this indicator could also be defined as income or consumption share held by the lowest x current mdg indicator but could be measured in various ways calorie availability can be measured at the country level based on national food balance sheets fao or at household level from food expenditure or consumption surveys fao uses country specific cut offs for minimum energy requirements calculated by the who for different age and gender groups this indicator could also be defined as the share of people consuming less than calories per day depending on the region to measure the proportion and total number of the most food insecure people a simple dietary diversity indicator that is well correlated with stunting wasting and low body mass index can be calculated from fao food balance sheets with staple foods consisting of cereals and root crops but preferably from more disaggregated data sources that also allow assessing distribution differences within a country or within households aspirational outcomes the number of people living on less than a day is effectively zero by in every country the share of people living below their countrys national poverty threshold is less than x the share of the population not able to meet minimum calorie requirements is effectively zero by in every country the share of calories from non staple foods has increased by by relative to a baseline the share of animal derived protein in the diet of women and young children has increased by possible indicators proportion of population with income below a day ppp proportion of population living below a countrys poverty line proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption share of calories from non staple foods prevalence of stunting in children under years of age prevalence of anemia in non pregnant women of reproductive age other indicators could be used too for example an indicator reflecting the share of animal protein in the diets of pregnant women and young children which is likely to be related to anemia stunting and other consequences of malnutrition defined as percentage of children under five years of age whose height for age is below minus two standard deviations from the median of the who child growth standards child growth data are widely available who has maintained the global database on child growth and malnutrition since good trend data already exist but more global training will be needed on how to properly measure height at young age some experts suggest to use a stunting indicator defined as up to age as a measure more sensitive to conditions for the most recently born proportion of non pregnant women in reproductive age yrs with hemoglobin concentration of g l at sea level anemia is diagnosed through finger prick blood sample tests the test could be easily integrated in regular health or prenatal visit to capture all women of reproductive age data on anemia prevalence collected in are available for of non pregnant women of reproductive age in countries in countries with high prevalence of malnutrition and low meat and dairy diets the global number of children under five two who are stunted as a result of malnutrition has been reduced by in relative to the baseline by no country has any child stunting beyond levels occurring in normal populations r anemia in non pregnant women of reproductive age has been reduced by in relative to a baseline set in the period target a and its indicators recognize that agriculture led growth is essential for ending poverty food insecurity and malnutrition although it has also been proposed to have a separate goal on food security and nutrition the sdsn proposes to include hunger and malnutrition under extreme poverty goal with the rationale that both are challenges that affect rural as well as urban areas hunger is not only a function of food availability stunting and malnutrition are key dimensions of extreme poverty and a single poverty hunger goal ensures full continuity with the current mdg continuing on current growth trends about of people will be in extreme poverty by hence with slightly faster growth it should be possible to eradicate extreme poverty gdp growth from agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth generated in the non agricultural sectors considering the huge importance of food prices relative to income for eradicating poverty another indicator could be defined that would relate food prices to incomes of different income segments it could provide some improvement over the first two indicators as it would allow for the immediate short term effects of food price spikes on real incomes and food security food and nutritional security in target a has four dimensions supply availability of enough food from diverse sources to meet the consumption needs of a healthy and nutritious diets by either feeding oneself directly from productive land or other natural resources or well functioning distribution processing and market systems r the world health assembly has endorsed a target aiming for a reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by which we extrapolate here to by as an ambitious target actual targets will vary widely by country depending on current prevalence of stunting complete elimination of stunting is not possible i e even in a healthy population a small proportion of children will fall below the cut off access all members of society must have economic and physical access to sufficient food for a healthy and nutritious diet through their incomes or special programs utilization people must be able to absorb the food s nutrients this involves sufficient intake diverse diets good food preparation intra household distribution of food access to clean water and sanitation and freedom from diseases and toxins that affect food utilization stability year round and year to year stability of the food supply as well as access and utilization of safe and nutritious food provides the foundation of food and nutritional security a broader vision of modern agriculture recognizes that solutions for reducing poverty and increasing incomes also need to be nutrition and equity sensitive beyond food staples we must ensure a stable and affordable supply of diverse micronutrient dense foods such as legumes pulses vegetables fruits dairy and livestock and aquatic resources thereby contributing to a more balanced healthy diet through a variety of innovations such as agronomic biofortification by adding micronutrients to fertilizers biofortification breeding or the promotion of vegetable gardens agriculture can improve food quality and health agricultural productivity improvements also provide increased income and employment opportunities that improve access to more nutritious food multi sector interventions including household food security and dietary diversity are most efficient in reducing child stunting we propose four indicators that address the major hunger and malnutrition problems that need to be overcome in our generation recognizing that many of the commonly used indices and measurement systems for food and nutritional security have shortcomings a calorie availability deprivation indicator of some kind is probably still needed to measure extreme forms of food insecurity undernourishment but also because traditionally used ones such as the fao index have a long history and reference base at national level however the nutritional relevance of calorie availability indicators is not always clear the currently used methods based on national food balance sheets fao or household consumption surveys all face sizeable measurement errors and limitations in terms of cross country comparability upscaling disaggregation and sensitivity to supply shocks measurement of hunger could probably be best obtained by collecting anthropometric data on stunted children or dietary diversity indicators that are powerful predictors of economic status and malnutrition both stunting and wasting both should be part of designing new monitoring systems at different scales nutritional interventions should focus on overcoming malnutrition in women of reproductive age particularly before and during pregnancy and in children in the first years of life for goals and we recommend adopting and extrapolating the six targets and indicators for maternal infant and under the age of nutrition that have recently been endorsed by the world health assembly they can be translated into realistic national targets based on the country specific context reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by reduction of anemia in non pregnant women of reproductive age by reduction of low birth weight by no increase in the prevalence of overweight in children under five by increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding without supplementary feedings in the first six months to reach at least by reduce childhood wasting to less than by and maintain it below that level child stunting is a robust non specific indicator of nutritional status and overall health including quantity and quality of dietary intake mother child pre and post natal exposure to infections environmental challenges and care giving it is linked to other adverse outcomes such as child mortality delayed development and lower wages as an adult anemia in women of reproductive age is another important nutrition related indicator anemia is closely linked to maternal mortality and other health risks it is a multi factorial disorder caused mainly by iron deficiency and infections and to a lesser extent by deficiencies of vitamin a vitamin b folate and riboflavin novel metrics that measure nutritional diversity in cropping systems could also be considered for defining a nutrition indicator that could be of particular relevance for smallholder farming areas goal achieve health and wellbeing at all ages achieve universal health coverage at every stage of life with particular emphasis on primary health services including reproductive health to ensure that all people receive quality health services without suffering financial hardship all countries promote policies to help individuals make healthy and sustainable decisions regarding diet physical activity and other individual or social dimensions of health target c promote healthy diets and physical activity discourage unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake and track subjective wellbeing and social capital possible indicators share of calories from non staple foods aspirational outcomes the share of calories from non staple foods has increased by by relative to a baseline comments similar to the indicator proposed for target a this simple dietary diversity indicator could be used to track progress towards healthier diets in general including in developed countries for that purpose it should be monitored at household level and disaggregated by income gender age etc per capita meat consumption kg per capita fraction of calories from added saturated fats and sugars prevalence of overweight and obese children under the age of years or annual rate of change diet indicator that could be applied to track progress towards consuming less energy intensive food in countries where a reduction in meat consumption is a major goal given the different nutritional and environmental impacts of consuming white chicken fish or red beef pork etc meat this indicator could also focus on red meat only in a different context it could also be applied as a nutrition related indicator in countries with low animal protein consumption and malnutrition increase or x decrease in per capita red meat consumption by relative to a baseline in countries with currently high per capita red meat consumption saturated fats and sugars are found naturally in some foods but are often added when foods are processed by food companies or when they are prepared this diet indicator could be used to limit and even reduce the health burdens from added saturated fats and sugars in processed foods child growth standards in children under age share of overweight weight for height above two standard deviations from the median of the who alternatively this indicator could also be defined as prevalence of overweight and obesity at all ages or using the body mass index bmi as a metric overweight is difficult to measure during early age with less reliable reference data available hence this indicator could also be measured for adolescent girls and women of child bearing age since that affects not only mothers but their children too increase or x decrease in the fraction of calories from added saturated fats and sugars by relative to a baseline increase in the prevalence of overweight in children under five girls and or adolescent girls and women of child bearing age by prevalence of food contamination in the food system to be defined to track indicator could be defined food an contamination caused by mycotoxins microbes or other food safety issues this indicator would provide an incentive to put surveillance systems in place to monitor food safety and support farmers traders and processors in reducing contaminants to be defined indicators for target c could address various aspects of the grand scale behavioral changes required to make a difference towards healthier less energy intensive food baskets with particular emphasis on reducing meat and sugar consumption among affluent consumers education is needed to ensure that the growing population understands the components of a healthy balanced diet recent examples focus on obesity and type ii diabetes including national social sensitization programs such as the usdas dietary guidelines the a day program in the uk where consumption of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables is promoted and public service programs from both the health medical and agriculture sectors the education sector must have a strong role in ensuring that children are involved as evidence shows that good eating and healthy habits start early in resource limited contexts women often lack the knowledge time or capability to provide balanced and adequate nutrition to their children agricultural and household drudgery can demand so much of womens time that they are unable to devote adequate time to childcare in these contexts effective interventions must engage men as well as women and children to reduce drudgery in agriculture or re balance workloads and diets reducing excess per capita meat consumption that of red meat from livestock as compared with chicken and fish in particular should be a major goal in those countries where it is among the major causes of cardiovascular disease diabetes and overweight and obesity in addition to health benefits this would also reduce the pressure on grain production and many environmental issues and thus allow meeting the targets of goals and hence a suitable indicator could be defined for this purpose for countries to set ambitious targets depending on their current consumption levels the prevalence of overweight in children under the age of five years has been steadily growing in the past years at an annual rate of to preventive interventions should combine healthy dietary practices e g breastfeeding and a diet rich in fruits vegetables nuts dairy products and whole grains and low in sugar sweetened beverages and increased level of physical activity overweight and obesity affect all age groups but an immediate objective could be to measure it in young children or adolescent girls and women of child bearing age for early identification of children at risk of overweight and undertaking early corrective actions if a country achieves no worsening of maternal obesity target c and improvement in maternal anemia target a many other health and gender related targets will be achieved in most countries data on diet for example is almost nonexistent hence each country should establish and maintain a national health and nutrition survey goal improve agriculture systems and raise rural prosperity improve farming practices rural infrastructure and access to resources for food production to increase the productivity of agriculture livestock and fisheries raise smallholder incomes reduce environmental impacts create better jobs promote rural prosperity and ensure resilience to climate change target a ensure sustainable food production systems with high yields and high efficiency of water nutrients and energy supporting nutritious diets with low food losses and waste possible indicators cereal yield growth rate p a aspirational outcomes annual yield growth rate of major food crops approaches or exceeds by crop yield gap actual yield as of yield potential livestock and fish productivity growth to be defined full chain nitrogen phosphorus use efficiency or rate of progress relative to a defined gap to close comments annual yield growth rate of major cereals maize rice wheat others expressed in or kg ha harvested land these crops are fundamental for achieving food and nutritional security this indicator is critical for assessing whether investments in productivity growth of major food crops have the desired results it could be disaggregated by cereal crops and sub national scales to verify progress against specific targets by crops and regions actual yield expressed as of water limited yield potential is a benchmark for productivity that also shows the exploitable yield gap it can be disaggregated by crops of highest priority for a country and is suitable for spatial disaggregation from local to global scales this indicator requires improved data collection and monitoring systems a suitable indicator should be defined that expresses progress being made towards more efficient and sustainable production of animal products the broader livestock production index used by the world bank is insufficiently nuanced for this because it includes meat and milk from all sources but also other dairy products eggs honey raw silk wool and hides skins defined as the ratio of nutrients in final products e g human food consumed to new nutrient inputs into terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric cycles e g nitrogen from chemical synthesis or biological n fixation minerals mined and applied as fertilizers etc it takes into account livestock and other stages of the food chain as well as recycling this indicator could track improvements in nutrient efficiencies along the full chain in countries with low efficiency levels because of different contexts specific targets would have to be country specific i e defined so as to reduce the gap between current and targeted full chain nutrient use efficiency levels this indicator could also be disaggregated further for example for major food systems chains a backcasting approach should be applied to identify technology and policy options for achieving specific full chain efficiency targets the majority of farms achieve of the attainable water limited yield potential by livestock and aquaculture productivity in developing countries has doubled by especially in sub saharan africa full chain efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus has increased by x relative to current levels in each country with sub optimal efficiency e g high nutrient consumption relative to actual yield for countries with low full chain efficiency an aspirational target could be to reach by a increase relative to current levels crop nitrogen use efficiency access to irrigation crop water productivity tons of harvested product per unit irrigation water share of agricultural produce loss and food waste of food production defined as the ratio of nitrogen in harvested crop products to the amount of nitrogen applied per cropping season or year it is directly related to the efficiency of fertilizer use on agricultural land including new technologies and stewardship programs targeting farmers and advisors interpretation and specific targets for crop nitrogen use efficiency are context specific primarily depending on yield current nitrogen use soil quality and other factors share of farmers or crop area with access to irrigation irrigation is an essential component of achieving food and nutritional security and reducing vulnerability in crop production many countries also in sub saharan africa have substantial potential for expanding irrigated agriculture in a sustainable manner concerns about unsustainable water consumption and depletion of water resources need to be addressed through additional indicators the proposed indicator is directly related to freshwater use for irrigation another alternative is to define water productivity as the efficiency with which water is converted to harvested product i e the ratio between yield and seasonal water supply including rainfall and irrigation methods developed by fao could be the basis for this indicator but they need to be improved further and first be applied to create a baseline staple crops that are often consolidated after harvest for processing will provide better data for assessment of losses to provide a baseline crops grown on a small scale and consumed at household level will be very difficult to quantify in this sense but are often those most affected by crop losses crop nitrogen efficiency increased by relative to current levels in countries with low efficiency unsustainable soil nutrient depletion halted and reversed in countries with insufficient nutrient use resulting in increased crop production and economic return the share of irrigated agricultural land has increased by x in countries with unexploited water resources water productivity of crop production has increased by in countries with high water use for irrigation post harvest losses and food waste have been reduced by in and by in relative to current levels target b halt forest and wetland conversion to agriculture protect soil and land resources and ensure that farming systems are resilient to climate change and disasters possible indicators annual change in forest area p a comments similar to the current mdg indicator but proposed to focus on the rate of change at national sub national and local levels to guide policy making and monitor implementation including the use of high resolution remote sensing this indicator could also be expressed in absolute terms square kilometers of forest area forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees excluding tree stands in agricultural production systems e g plantations agroforestry systems and trees in urban parks and gardens the indicator could be expanded to also include wetlands or other critical ecosystems aspirational outcomes annual forest conversion to crop or livestock agriculture by all countries have policies and enforcement systems in place to protect their most critical natural ecosystems rate of change in arable land area p a land area without major constraints to agriculture or ha or net rate of change proportion of farmers or rural communities covered by flood drought and heat protection systems defined by fao as land under temporary crops double cropped areas are counted once temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture land under market or kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow this indicator could track expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems as well as the loss of productive agricultural land to housing industry roads and other uses which may threaten a country s food security agricultural land not affected by x major soil fertility constraints or land degradation based on established soil and land assessment methods and utilizing new digital mapping and monitoring efforts based on a globally harmonized methodology countries could define their own minimum list of specific land constraints that need to be tracked with regard to achieving land degradation neutrality or even improvement of land quality the latter is important for countries that need to overcome major soil or land quality constraints for example in sub saharan africa an indicator could be defined to quantify the proportion of farmers that have access to have adopted new stress tolerant varieties and other resilience enhancing technologies and or are covered by policies alert systems crop insurance and other preparedness measures in areas that are most at risk to suffer from extreme climatic events annual change in fertile arable land area by net land degradation by i e achieve a land degradation neutral world at least of farmers have adopted soil and water conserving production practices and all farmers have access to stress tolerant adapted varieties all countries have policies alert systems insurance solutions social safety nets and other preparedness measures in place by to support farmers in years when crops or animals suffer target c ensure universal access in rural areas to basic resources and infrastructure services land water sanitation modern energy transport mobile and broadband communication agricultural inputs and advisory services possible indicators proportion of smallholder farmers with secure rights to land comments secure land tenure is a key determinant for implementing sustainable agricultural intensification measures this indicator could express land tenure status as the percentage of farmers households who have secure permanent ownership or affordable long term lease of the land they farm disaggregated by region income and gender women in particular need to be given better access to land which should also be tracked with this indicator aspirational outcomes at least of all farmers have secure ownership or affordable long term leases of the land they farm access to improved water source in rural areas access to improved sanitation rural electrification rate access to paved roads access within x km distance to road access to drying storage and processing facilities to be defined broadband mobile phone subscribers in rural areas proportion of rural households with access to low interest credit similar to current mdg indicator but following the world bank definition percentage of the population with reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved source such as a household connection public standpipe borehole protected well or spring and rainwater collection reasonable access is defined as the availability of at least liters a person a day from a source within one kilometer of the dwelling percentage of households with access to effective sanitation sanitation is a critical part of public health and impacts agriculture poor sanitation reduces household health due to infection and poor sanitation can affect the water source for communities as well as for agricultural production and postharvest value addition thus compromising the health of consumers percentage of rural households with access to electricity either through traditional grids micro grids village level or household supply ex rooftop solar data should be disaggregated as to whether the source is renewable or not to track progress on targets for renewable energy electricity is critical for cost efficient agriculture as well as effective processing and storage of agricultural produce access to paved roads is critical for many rural development processes including access to inputs markets education and health services this indicator could be defined as percentage of rural households who are within x km of good quality paved roads and or rail that provide connectivity to markets good infrastructure for drying and storing agricultural produce is critical for high quality and value as well as for reducing losses and contamination by mycotoxins or other food contaminants rural processing capacity would provide employment opportunities enhance access to markets and facilitate value addition including the production of foods to enhance infant child nutrition and reduce maternal drudgery combines mdg indicators and total number or percentage of rural households or people who have pre or post paid cellular phone subscriptions with broadband connectivity the indicator emphasizes broadband access as a key means for internet connectivity and thus access to more information and services access to affordable credit at the right time is critical for farmers to buy the inputs and services needed it is also critical for many small and medium size rural enterprises including many run by women this indicator could be defined as percentage of rural households who have access to sufficient financing at interest rates below x alternatively it could also be defined as the average rural lending rate at least of all households in rural areas have access to good quality water sources at least of all households in rural areas have access to improved sanitation at least of all households in rural areas have access to affordable electricity at least of all households in rural areas have access to good quality roads connecting them with local markets at least of all households in rural areas have access to affordable local drying storage and processing facilities at least of all households in rural areas have broadband internet connectivity at least of all households in rural areas have access to low interest financing for critical agricultural capital inputs and services doing business in agriculture index or indicators agricultural extension professionals per farmers employment rate of rural youth and women further refining the doing business indicator used by the world bank an index or indicators could track different areas of the investment climate for small and medium agribusinesses i e areas where policy reforms are most needed to stimulate business growth inputs farm services land water finance insurance transport and markets etc without a functioning public private extension system it is not possible to succeed with sai an indicator should be defined that tracks the total number of qualified agricultural professionals across different sectors that provide training information and other extension support and services to farmers and small to medium enterprises in rural value chains this indicator should include professionals with a minimum level of education training certification working in the public private and civil society sectors related to target c percentage of young people age and women employed in rural areas disaggregated by region and income a youth and women employment indicator would track progress being made in creating new better jobs in rural areas to be identified discussions on developing new indicators are currently underway in the benchmarking the business of agriculture initiative in response to a g call all farmers have access to quality agricultural advisory services that provide locally relevant knowledge information and other services increase in rural youth and women employment through the creation of new and better jobs in agricultural value chains and service sectors in rural areas the indicators and aspirational outcomes proposed for targets a c reflect multiple dimensions involved in implementing sai including genetic agro ecological and socioeconomic innovations and the necessary enabling systems fig growth in agricultural production can come from area expansion or intensification increasing yield or cropping intensity per unit of agricultural land reliance on area expansion in latin america and sub saharan africa must be limited whereas in many parts of asia north america and europe critical resources such as water and mineral fertilizers need to be managed more efficiently future growth in crop production will have to come from existing land whenever possible by increasing yields and reducing losses and waste this will be a primary requisite for reducing the expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems and thus for achieving target b however increasing productivity through sai by itself may often not be sufficient to spare natural ecosystems from destruction increasing profits may result in an incentive for conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture e g forests hence other instruments to use include comprehensive conservation policies land use planning and adequate governance including carefully crafted and enforced protection of critical natural ecosystems simultaneously we will have to address unsustainable extraction of freshwater resources increase nutrient efficiency and adapt to climate change similarly increases in production of animal source foods need to come primarily from increased productivity per animal rather than increased animal numbers any slowdown in productivity growth would mean that more land water energy fertilizer pesticides labor and other inputs would be needed to meet the rising food demand thus also raising the cost of food the plateauing of cereal yields in intensive production systems needs to be overcome yield gaps will have to be closed in both the crop and livestock components of smallholder agricultural systems of the developing world and incentives need to be provided for protecting soil resources all this requires sensitive measurable indicators that can track progress in these areas other interesting options for indicators for target a should be explored since many biofuel crops directly compete with food production and also have other sustainability issues an indicator could be defined that reflects the need to restrain the use of land for biofuels relative to food production moreover an indicator such as the annual growth in total factor productivity tfp could capture productivity growth as a whole and has been used more widely in recent years other indicators could measure the productivity of agricultural labor or land relative to the agricultural value produced and cereal prices they could also be disaggregated by sub sector crops and livestock the use of value addition in cereal equivalents rather than gross production in all these measures allows for technical and economic efficiency for the effects of large changes in real staple food prices and for value differences across different agricultural products the availability of reliable data at sub national to district level will largely determine which indicators can be used in conjunction with the targets for goal target b focuses on critical natural resources for agriculture or affected by agriculture including soil and land resources that form the basis for food security the demand for fertile soil is increasing as the world population grows and is moving up the food chain the mostly policy driven bioenergy sector has further increased the demand for agricultural land on site effects of soil degradation contribute to food insecurity and limit rural development off site effects of soil degradation such as sedimentation of reservoirs and streambeds eutrophication of waterbodies caused by erosion and co emissions caused by soil organic matter loss do not stop at national borders avoiding soil degradation and restoring degraded soils need to be addressed at a global as well as national level the rio outcome document proposed to aim for a land degradation neutral world in which any land degradation has to be minimized and any unavoidable land degradations needs to be offset by regeneration a natural process without human effort and restoration an active process induced by human effort the third indicator proposed for target b tries to capture this but others could be defined including a more specific one that focuses on soil fertility constraints for example the sustainable development path requires a re thinking of rural development and smallholder agriculture towards structural transformations that include and benefit the poor through new farming systems technologies and business models that allow overcoming land constraints and enable greater market participation thus creating new job opportunities we propose several indicators for target c that could address this a land tenure indicator would track ownership secure lease of land which is one of the major constraints faced by farmers in developing countries insecurity about land prevents many from investing in productivity enhancing measures it is a prerequisite for implementing sai and making use of modern technologies without secure tenure to land hundreds of millions of smallholders will not be able to access credit or make major investments in soil improvement machinery or other critical technologies the voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests in the context of national food security which were developed through widespread global consultations and adopted by the committee on world food security in provide helpful guidance on securing land tenure sustainable agricultural intensification along whole value chains is an engine of socially inclusive growth in rural areas giving a boost to smallholder farmers and new rural businesses along the value chain the agriculture and food sector plays a key role in rural job creation particularly for women and youth interventions aimed at improving access to markets improved technologies and productive assets are key to enhancing smallholder participation in value chains and thus escaping poverty traps and subsistence farming equitable sustainable development requires recognizing the potential of rural areas by making villages and towns places that offer well paid work and support proper education s soil degradation is not fully avoidable soil erosion rates on arable land for example are typically one or two orders of magnitude higher that soil reproduction rates health and cultural infrastructure to allow farmers and small rural enterprises to participate in the market governments have to direct greaterinvestments to rural transport energy provision irrigation water supply sanitation services communication prompt dissemination of information and improved crop storage infrastructure professional agricultural advisory services will play a major role in implementing sai new models must be found to speed up the delivery of new technologies through public and private sector channels in addition to professional advisory services farmers need their own innovation and knowledge sharing networks which can link strategically to such services goal curb human induced climate change and ensure sustainable energy curb greenhouse gas emissions from energy industry agriculture the built environment and land use change to ensure a peak of global co emissions by and to head off the rapidly growing dangers of climate change promote sustainable energy for all target b reduce non energy related emissions of greenhouse gases through improved practices in agriculture forestry waste management and industry possible indicators greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture tons co equivalent per unit food equivalent produced aspirational outcomes ghg emissions from agriculture reduced by relative to current levels per unit food equivalent comments greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agriculture including direct and indirect emissions from crop and livestock production forestry and associated land use changes based on a new fao database providing a complete and coherent time series of emission statistics over a reference period at country level using faostat http faostat fao org activity data and ipcc methodology the ipcc tier approach has high uncertainty because it is heavily based on global default emission factors hence this indicator should be improved by utilizing country specific emission factors that are increasingly becoming available tier approach in agriculture a range of management practices can make substantial contributions to reducing ghg emissions e g adoption of management practices to increase soil carbon sequestration nutrient stewardship programs that reduce nitrous oxide emissions or management practices that reduce methane emissions from rice or livestock depending on data availability and reliability an indicator could be defined to track the adoption of such measures or their total impact on ghg savings at different scales adoption of ghg saving management practices in agriculture area under ghg saving management practices or tons of co equivalent adoption of ghg saving management practices has increased to x of the agricultural area food systems as a whole contribute about of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions releasing gt co equivalent in agricultural production including indirect emissions associated with land cover change contributes to of total food system emissions with significant regional variation there are many opportunities for reducing ghg emissions on both the demand and the supply sides of the global food system including some triple win solutions that could contribute to mitigation adaptation and improved food security investment in yield improvements is among the most important mitigation strategies it has been estimated that that each dollar invested in agricultural yields has resulted in fewer kg co equivalent emissions relative to technology avoiding gt co equivalent per year hence an indicator for target b should be a yield adjusted indicator expressing ghg emissions per ton of product produced which is more consistent with sai principles than an indicator tracking gross ghg emission from agriculture this would also allow taking differences among countries into account a populous country in sub saharan africa in which population will double by can probably not be expected to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture compared to present data availability and reliability will by and large drive what indicators to use other indicators for target b could be defined to more specifically track the adoption of climate smart agriculture technologies contributing to mitigation of ghg for example carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and trees nutrient management stewardship programs that contribute to reducing nitrous oxide emissions or water saving irrigation to reduce methane emissions from rice provided that reliable and affordable mechanisms for scientific verification implementation and monitoring can be established effective policy and business mechanisms need to be created to allow participation of farmers in recognized global regional and national ghg reduction schemes thus providing additional incentives for adopting resource conserving production practices that can reduce ghg emissions but also increase productivity input efficiency and or lower production costs goal secure ecosystem services and biodiversity and ensure good management of water and other natural resources biodiversity marine and terrestrial ecosystems of local regional and global significance are inventoried managed and monitored to ensure the continuation of resilient and adaptive life support systems and to support sustainable development water and other natural resources are managed sustainably and transparently to support inclusive economic and human development target a ensure resilient and productive ecosystems by adopting policies and legislation that address drivers of ecosystem degradation and requiring individuals businesses and governments to pay the social cost of pollution and use of environmental services possible indicators genetic diversity of terrestrial domesticated animals aspirational outcomes the adopting of cross breeds with improved genetics has increased by x and the genetic diversity of domesticated animals farmed has increased by x relative to current levels the genetic diversity of cultivated crops farmed has been effectively conserved and is widely utilized in crop improvement programs deposition of non indigenous nutrients on natural ecosystems terrestrial and aquatic has been reduced by at least relative to current levels with several countries going further to reach levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem comments in the absence of direct measures at genetic level the status of domestic breed populations provides the best available indication of trends in diversity this indicator is based on the domestic animal diversity information system of fao dad is dad fao org dad is covers more than species used for food and agriculture and includes data on the size and structure of breed populations www bipindicators net domesticatedanimals a suitable indicator could be defined to track the status of conservation of critical crop genetic resources and its utilization in crop improvement programs this indicator could complement the nutrient efficiency indictors proposed for target a by focusing more explicitly on direct losses of biologically and chemically reactive nutrient forms that are caused by various mechanisms from fertilizer human and animal waste industry or organic amendments they often result in transport of such compounds by air or water to distant areas in nutrient limited ecosystems this leads to eutrophication of freshwater streams lakes genetic diversity of cultivated plant species to be defined loss of reactive nitrogen phosphorus to the environment kg ha and coastal ecosystems acidification of forests and soils and loss of biodiversity this indicator is more difficult to measure and mainly of interest to selected countries in which high nutrient loads cause damage to ecosystem functions www bipindicators net nitrogenloss function and biodiversity target c all governments and businesses commit to the sustainable integrated and transparent management of water agricultural land forests fisheries mining and hydrocarbon resources to support inclusive economic development and the achievement of all sdgs possible indicators extent of forest and forest types coverage of protected areas or km proportion of fish stock in safe biological limits annual water withdrawal by agriculture million cubic meters share of land fisheries and forest area covered by responsible governance policies comments mdg indicator and similar to the forest indicator under target b but focusing on less regular larger scale assessment the extent of forests is one of the key indicators developed to track progress towards mdg global assessments of the worlds forests are currently carried out at year intervals by fao www bipindicators net forestextent this indicator could be expanded or supplemented with other indicators to also track the extent and quality other ecosystems particularly wetlands calculated using all designated protected areas recorded in the world database on protected areas wdpa with a known size including marine and terrestrial protected areas global regional and national time series from onwards www bipindicators net pacoverage a measure of the sustainability of fishery resources in the context of aquatic ecosystem sustainability it reflects fishery production and its social economic benefits and can be used for the formulation of fishery policy and the development of fishery management plans the fao assessment classifies fish stocks into three categories overexploited fully exploited and under exploited www bipindicators net fishstocksinsafebiologicallimits an indicator for the overall trends in water consumption measured at different scales e g regional basin national watershed irrigation system it could also be defined as agriculture s share of total water consumption or in relation to the amount of water that can be used sustainably in an area based on voluntary guidelines for responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests countries need to develop their own laws and policies an indicator should be defined that tracks progress in implementing such laws and guidelines aspirational outcomes by the rate of net loss of all natural habitats including forests is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero by including land reclaimed or reconverted from agriculture to wetland or forest degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced at least of terrestrial and inland water and of coastal and marine areas especially areas of importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services are protected all fish stocks are managed and legally harvested sustainably within their biological limits applying ecosystem based approaches so that overfishing is avoided water withdrawal for agriculture is within agreed limits to avoid unsustainable withdrawal of water resources laws and policies for responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests are implemented on at least of a country s land area incentives harmful to biodiversity are eliminated share of extractive industries income spent on rural development and environmental protection an indicator should be defined that tracks a country s progress in utilizing income generated from extractive industries to support rural infrastructure development goal and environmental protection goal i e measures that particularly benefit the poor in low or middle income countries at least of a country s income from extractive industries and other land development investments is utilized to support socially inclusive rural development and environmental protection measures in the medium to long term farmers have no economic or other incentive to destroy the environment they operate in they care about the quality of their land the quality and safety of food they produce and the environment notwithstanding this agriculture can negatively impact the environment in many ways and it plays a major role in ensuring that critical ecosystems on earth are preserved resilient and fully functional concepts tools and mechanisms for valuing ecosystem services need to be fully developed and they need to lead to action including participation by millions of smallholder farmers and including benefits for them agricultural ecosystems must be managed as part of the wider landscape reinforcing natural resilience successful strategies for biodiversity management and ecosystem preservation are complex to design and require coordinated policies over a long time frame they need to be based on science but generally include a combination of voluntary guidelines enforced legal protection of critical natural ecosystems social mobilization and changing business behavior the proposed sdg targets a and c in conjunction with the other sdgs cover many of the aichi biodiversity targets www cbd int sp targets which were developed under the convention for biological diversity as operational milestones to be achieved by we generally support these targets and extrapolate some of them to however the diversity and specificity of ecosystems around the world makes it difficult to select just a few outcome targets and indicators that are applicable in every country countries need to achieve locally defined targets to record and manage their key ecosystems by adopting policies and legislation that address drivers of degradation and biodiversity loss and require individuals businesses and governments to pay the social cost of pollution and for the use of environmental services we only provide a few examples of possible indicators that could be used to track the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity and ecosystem services many more have been proposed by numerous organizations to monitor multiple dimensions of ecosystem health in agricultural landscapes for example those proposed by the biodiversity indicators partnership www bipindicators net actual usage will primarily depend on data availability and reliability which would require substantial investments in improving current monitoring systems particularly in low income and fragile countries water use cuts across goals agriculture cities and industry and ecosystems here we include a proposed indicator that focuses on tracking freshwater use by agriculture as the largest water consuming sector by over of the world s population may be living in river basins experiencing severe water stress many countries face growing water stress and virtually all must improve the integrated and sustainable management of their water resources this will require long term strategies involving governments communities and businesses to balance sustainable supply and use reduce water loss improve water retention and lower pollution regions countries and local communities need to have a clear understanding of the peak limits to freshwater use in order to develop sound policies and implementation guidelines for sustainable management and governance of water resources at different scales following recently agreed voluntary guidelines for responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests countries should craft their own policies to ensure equitable inclusive access by the rural poor to these critical resources growth corridors driven by extractive industries mining hydrocarbons as well as other agribusiness driven large scale land development schemes are penetrating rapidly into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of resources and access to markets particularly in africa although this could unleash major improvements in rural infrastructure and expansion of arable crops governance weaknesses may also lead to environmental damage and further marginalization of poor smallholders transparent governance and management of these developments is urgently needed including laws and policies that ensure sustainable practices and equitable revenue sharing to support environmental protection and rural development rural and agricultural development are also much influenced by industries drawing rural labor into factories and industrial zones the export of human capital to other countries and extractive industries oil gas coal minerals as a mega sector of many economies all of these can be a significant source of investment for speeding up structural transformation in rural areas the post agenda will need to find creative institutional and policy instruments to harness this potential to advance food security and inclusive rural development including suitable indicators that capture these processes and their environmental impact goal transform governance for sustainable development the public sector business and other stakeholders commit to good governance including transparency accountability access to information participation an end to tax and secrecy havens and efforts to stamp out corruption the international rules governing international finance trade corporate reporting technology and intellectual property are made consistent with achieving the sdgs the financing of poverty reduction and global public goods including efforts to head off climate change are strengthened and based on a graduated set of global rights and responsibilities target b adequate domestic and international public finance for ending extreme poverty providing global public goods capacity building and transferring technologies including percent of gni in oda for all high income countries and an additional billion per year in official climate financing by possible indicators share of government spending on agriculture aspirational outcomes during the entire period all countries with an agriculture based economy spend at least of their national budgets on supporting the agricultural sector in their country during the entire period annual government spending on agricultural research and extension increases by at least per year in low and medium income countries agricultural research intensity reaches at least of agricultural gdp comments this indicator measures the proportion of the national government budget spent on agriculture it should also measure the actual release or utilization of funds because the share of agriculture in the overall economy declines as countries move up the ladder the targets for this indicator may vary accordingly african governments in caadp have agreed to increase public investment in agriculture to a minimum of of their national budgets the indicator could be further disaggregated to track spending by sectors or specific target groups a suitable indicator needs to be defined to express a country s agricultural r d commitment with specific targets to be set by each country one possibility is to define it as growth rate in agricultural r d spending another indicator is the agricultural research intensity ratio which expresses agricultural research spending relative to agricultural gross domestic product gdp but and requires in the agricultural science and technology asti database www asti cgiar org interpretation country data are available context specific target setting agricultural r d spending change p a or of agricultural gdp share of oda spending on agriculture proportion of bilateral oda funds allocated to agriculture including forestry and fisheries including support for r d human resources development and institutional capacity building www oecd org dac stats during the entire period all high income countries meet the of gross national income gni target for oda spend at least of their oda funding on agriculture and spend an additional x on rural development increasing and sustaining investment in agriculture and food systems in a responsible manner is essential for sustainable development both domestic government spending and official development assistance oda play a key role in implementing the sai agenda both require sustained commitments to meet the minimum investment levels required and those making critical decisions need to be well informed and able to prioritize and target investments based on the best available evidence countries need to set their own ambitious targets for agricultural and rural development a combination of public and private financing will be required to ensure full coverage of all investment needs in an equitable manner governments must lead by committing to strong and sustained support of the agricultural sector most low income countries and agriculture based or transition economies particularly those in sub saharan africa should aim to spend at least of their national or state budgets on accelerating agricultural growtht transparent principles and mechanisms are needed to ensure that farmers small producers and businesses and women in particular are at the center of the investment strategy and also benefit from investments in public goods such as infrastructure price support for inputs and outputs research and extension investments in public agricultural research should receive high priority and be of a more long term strategic nature to be effective national research and extension systems need to establish minimum capacities across all relevant disciplines and major commodities as private sector r d is concentrated on fewer commodities technologies and markets than public r d and the intellectual property created is not equally accessible this can be a transformational change globally annual growth in agricultural r d spending averaged for the period but many low to middle income countries have already accelerated their agricultural r d spending to annual rates of or more in recent years we propose that this should be a minimum sustained target for all developing countries although some starting from a lower base may have to do even more most low to middle income countries should aim to spend at least of their agricultural gdp on public agricultural r d new models for research and extension systems are need in many countries to also ensure better focus and more sustainable funding farmer driven research and extension models would ensure greater focus on issues important to them aid to agriculture from oda programs by developed countries and multilateral agencies fell from about us billon in the mid s to a little over us billion in the mid su as a proportion of total oda financing the share of aid to agriculture declined from to during the same period revealing a clear relative neglect of the sector agricultural oda funding has increased to over us billion current value in recent years but its share was still only of total oda in www oecd org dac stats oda investments in agriculture need to accelerate to make up for nearly years of neglect and these higher investments need to continue over the long term all donors need to commit to meeting minimum targets in just three countries the united states japan and t we cite this as an aspirational target based on what has been proposed in caadp www nepad caadp net u the oecd analysis includes dac countries and multilateral agencies france accounted for more than half of all bilateral aid commitments to agriculture and only three countries finland france and switzerland allocated or more of their oda funds to agriculture we propose that all donor countries should meet the agriculture oda target and that donors also should ensure that no country in need is neglected utilization of oda on agriculture should be monitored in a transparent more effective manner to ensure that it achieves the expected results target b should also be concerned with effective and efficient use of available domestic and international finance for agricultural development for which an indicator could be defined other indices can be used for scoring the broader performance of the agricultural sector and its changes over time discussions are currently ongoing to develop a new agricultural transformation index ati made up of sub indices or component indicators which would provide actionable measures of country performance and also help measure aid effectiveness www agriculturaltransformationindex org agribusiness and investment climate inclusiveness of policies productivity sustainability and markets could be among the performance areas to be included in such an index improving metrics data and access to information without clear metrics and a well designed research and institutional approach to make the metrics operational reaching the targets for sustainable development will remain an amorphous goal countries must have the capacities to measure robust indicators of progress metrics for agriculture and nutrition are needed that steer policy production and consumption decisions along a course that will lead to continuous improvements metrics are important for setting a baseline by which to measure progress tracking and anticipating socioeconomic nutritional and ecological change diagnosing constraints constructively engaging public private and ngo participants and identifying appropriate policy responses indicators inform action but many of the currently used metrics are inadequate or in conflict with each other obscuring clear guidelines for policymakers and practitioners unfortunately estimating even basic metrics on crop yields prevalence rates and patterns of different aspects of food security or environmental impact remains difficult the statistical capacities of sub saharan african countries for example have fallen into disarray resulting in numbers that substantially misstate the actual state of affairs efforts to evaluate the cross sectoral performance of agriculture are currently hugely hampered by insufficient data inconsistent measurement protocols uncertainties about the right scale of measurement weaknesses in models and lack of investment in monitoring systems that take full advantage of new technologies such as remote sensing aggregate national data provided by international organizations such as fao and the world bank are often used to capture agricultural production and input use changes in land use food supplies available for consumption per capita and average poverty rates that infer food access these data typically fail to account for in food production and consumption shocks associated with weather and war and uncertainties related to market and climate dynamics local social characteristics such as net producer vs consumer status education and health are absent in these aggregate metrics ecological change related to soils water and crop genetic diversity is not measured consistently across countries at scales that matter for private sector investment and policy response local measures of economic social and ecological change when implemented are often costly discontinuous over time and inconsistent from one location to another such measures can be useful for addressing specific problems at certain times and locations but they require significant scaling to be beneficial for monitoring regional and global food systems developing a core set of agreed upon indicators and collecting the necessary data in a systematic and reliable manner is a matter of high priority and will require substantial investment in people and infrastructure including new information technology from a policy and decision making standpoint income distribution agricultural waste seasonal swings information would be most useful for what sorts of implementing a sustainable agricultural intensification in the future in chapter we discussed as examples a set of indicators that could be used to monitor the major outcomes of sustainable agricultural intensification food and nutritional security economic and social development and environmental sustainability and some of the enabling components required many of them fulfill the main requirements box but some will also require further analysis and improvement subsequently we discuss some of the major data gaps and make suggestions for how to gradually overcome them box key consideration for metrics used in monitoring agriculture metrics must be well defined and meaningful have a clear mechanistic meaning and relation to specific development goals targets measurable motivational for positive change and easy to understand and to communicate to those who need to be the agents of change in the future farmers policy makers executives consumers youth etc metrics should provide cross sectional representation and thus include measurement of biophysical economic social and nutritional change metrics must allow measuring trends over time against a well established baseline and they should allow integrated assessment across different scales a central objective of sustainable development is to ensure social inclusion metrics should go beyond reporting average national indicators where appropriate and feasible metrics should be disaggregated according to gender geography socioeconomic status disability ethnicity age and other dimensions in order to track and address marginalization and inequalities across sub populations in practice the choice among metrics involves trade offs in terms of precision scale and cost it is thus important to clarify the goals of measurement from the outset irrespective of current constraints an overall minimum set of universal indicators is needed these should be consistent metrics that provide broad general information that can be supplemented with others that are more tailored to regional or local applications or to specific questions in order to avoid an oppressive list of indicators that might be inconsistent across time or space it is also important to identify proxies that can cover several of these information criteria engaging the intended users in developing the right metrics and involving them in the data collection and interpretation of results is likely to increase the chance for success an adaptive measurement strategy is needed to ensure that metrics and monitoring procedures evolve as the relevant questions for sustainable agricultural intensification change over time particularly with regard to ecological and environmental questions enabling conditions should be created for stakeholders to advance the metrics monitoring and modeling can play complementary roles indicators should be few with well tested methodology guidelines and tools to be shared with countries to allow them to develop their own metrics and collect data on their own efforts should be made to support countries in taking ownership of those few sdg indicators at the ministerial and institutional level and assist them with adopting the best available data collection methods metrics should make use of already available international and national data significant investments should focus on improving local national and global data collection and processing including using new tools gis remote sensing social networking mobile phones crowd sourcing etc as well as existing ones where applicable on farm and within village measurement capability should be created using information technology as a result of the information revolution the sdgs should be supported by online real time place based and highly disaggregated data resulting in public databases for monitoring and public participation at present aggregate data and models are widely used to assess the current status and make projections on food demand and supply agricultural inputs poverty hunger and malnutrition numerous uncertainties are inherent to this approach both in terms of the quality of the available data and the assumptions used in projection models exaggerations or distortions are not uncommon detailed studies with complex conclusions are often turned into simplistic media messages rather than more nuanced conclusions moreover many of the actual solutions will need to be implemented at sub national scales all the way down to the household farm field and even within field scales where changes in behavior as well as precision farming technologies will be a critical condition for success there is a need to create in each country a central register using baseline census data population and agriculture and update these records regularly with data from many other sources including surveys rapid monitoring satellite images on crop area cultivated yield etc the national household survey mechanism should still be supported but simplified and made easy for respondents so as to get more reliable information on issues not captured by census and administrative records international organizations such as the agencies funds and programs of the united nations should support countries in improving the quality and timeliness of data collection where official development assistance is required to finance improved data systems these investments should be supported so that progress in achieving the sdgs can be monitored in real time we need to simplify the data collection methods using simple questionnaires at different time periods with the right technology age census data can be linked to a countrys administrative records so that each individual record is automatically updated thus avoiding time consuming and expensive surveys large uncertainties persist in terms of future population growth and structural transformations that are likely to shift food consumption patterns by urban and rural consumers uncertainties also concern the relative roles of net producers and net consumers such as where they are or how they respond to agricultural market fluctuations africa india and china are of particular importance because they together account for more than half of the worlds population and the majority of the worlds food insecure we cannot tell for sure whether the worlds population will be or billion people by but it is critical to know where additional people will be and what they will eat an additional billion people has huge implications for additional food need but it can also result in the loss of over million hectares of agricultural land to urbanization data on consumption are often unreliable and so are data on postharvest losses and food waste existing estimates of key aspects of market behavior that underpin existing economic models are often sparse and inconsistent it is difficult to assess understand and project changes in consumer behavior because of large cultural and economic differences among and within countries such information needs to be collected more regularly primarily at the household level and food chain scales on the food consumption side what policymakers need are cross sectional information that includes comparisons between different social groups regions and net producers vs net consumers information on long term trends patterns of seasonality and impact of production shocks on food intake and incomes data on nutritional intake that include macro and micro nutrients over time both seasonal and year to year and space within and between countries available measures of fao the world bank and other organizations on the number of people classified as living in extreme poverty chronically hungry or suffering from specific nutritional deficiencies are imperfect there are poverty headcount maps for many countries however we generally do not have spatial data on poverty gaps or hunger and hunger data are not very reliable because they are often food balance sheet based they need to be disaggregated further to sub national and even local scales in rural and urban areas and they need to be updated regularly average or aggregate national data that are years old will not help with better targeting of policy decisions and investments to the areas where they are most needed the various agencies involved in the agriculture and health sectors should develop common and internationally comparable dietary quality indicators from household survey data ideally with separate indicators for children women and men just as important as collecting better data is the development of a new generation of food system models for policymakers that fully incorporate nutrition environmental and climate elements and their interactions on the supply side numerous uncertainties exist about the general quality of agricultural and other statistics in many countries including data on crop and livestock production fertilizer use irrigation water labor agrochemicals and many others the available information on fertilizer and pesticide use by crops for example is sparse in product detail and spatial resolution not up to date and generally not verified at farm scale accurate information on cropping area crop yields crop livestock damage by stresses and disasters climate projections food consumption trade ending stocks non food uses of crops food prices and postharvest losses is critical for improving market forecasts early warning systems and policy decisions it is currently not available for many countries delayed or only collected at coarse resolution by national statistical agencies that in many countries lack human resources technology and operational funds instead it must be spatially dense transparent and timely which will also require using new remote sensing technology and forecasting models full participation by all information providers and analysts is essential including those from the private sector a collaborative effort has recently been initiated to establish a new agricultural market information system amis but it is currently limited to the g countries and few non g countries it needs to be substantially improved in terms of spatial resolution and coverage as well as quality of data real time high resolution satellite imagery particularly radar that penetrates clouds can be of tremendous value for improving basic crop statistics for making crop forecasts and for assessing crop damage the technology has already been demonstrated for contrasting regions including commercial scale corn farming in the usa assessing temporal changes in rice cropping in nepal and real time monitoring of smallholder agriculture in malawi it needs to become available to everyone adapted for all of the worlds major agricultural systems and effectively utilized by national statistical agencies similar efforts are needed to improve many others agricultural statistics including for the livestock and fisheries sectors uncertainties also exist about the potential and actual trajectories for agricultural land development and the exploitable productivity gaps some progress has recently been made in disaggregating crop yields and yield gaps at national and sub national levels but these studies have still relied on globally available census data and other relatively coarse information promising new methodologies for more standardized yield gap analysis have recently been developed which will allow developing a new global yield gap atlas www yieldgap org long term weather and soil data at high spatial resolution are among the most important data for supporting sai approaches but they represent major data gaps in many countries given the concerns about climate change and adaptation to it and about precision management in relation to real time environmental conditions this should be among the highest priorities for the global community concerned with food security all farmers and their advisors and researchers must have access to both long term weather data and real time weather data at a high degree of spatial resolution more accurate digital information on soils and nutrients is of particular importance because it affects decisions on fertilizer policies and management crops that can be grown land development strategies and investments land rehabilitation efforts and many other things progress is being made in developing digital soil information systems that combine legacy data with new remote sensing technology and fast soil analysis methods and thus increase the spatial resolution and quality of the available information new systems such as the africa soil information service www africasoils net will fill major gaps and will allow customized products and services for diverse stakeholders to be developed however they will require continuous large r d support and suitable business models for more self sustained operation and they also need to spread to all major agricultural areas in the world on the other hand no global nutrient monitoring system exists yet and the currently available data are highly unreliable for many countries or key components of the whole nutrient chain such information is critical for guiding policies as well as for tailoring nutrient management and stewardship programs so that they can achieve productivity efficiency social and environmental targets with current data and modeling climate data cannot easily be extrapolated to provide conclusive local recommendations therefore a more precise agriculture will also require long term and real time weather information for all major crop producing regions with fine spatial resolution we also need to know more about the adoption of new technologies and about which areas currently used for production of staple food crops are in a spiral of land degradation we need to build a whole new global system for monitoring the performance of agriculture at a fine scale see chapter and reward farmers who make steady progress towards improving their metrics our ultimate ambition should be to monitor through various means nearly every hectare of existing farmland within the next years complete coverage of all farmland will only be possible through use of new digital technologies including mobile phone platforms for bottom up collection of farm and farmer information a global effort is needed to design test and scale the necessary data platforms analytical and implementation tools and train human resources in both the public and private sector on how to use digital technologies in agriculture strengthening data collection capacity at the national level is of high priority but it also needs to be extended to the local government level the situation has become even more complex in recent years as a result of the resurging interest in statistics on agriculture and food systems with many more organizations collecting their own data in an uncoordinated non integrated manner governments and international organizations such as un organizations the world bank regional development banks and international agricultural research centers have a long history of collecting data but without proper integration of their data systems in addition more and more private companies and foundations as well as many ngos are collecting data through in house units projects or outsourcing to third parties by and large it is reasonable to assume that many of the real or perceived data gaps could already be filled if ways could be found to better align these efforts harmonize methodologies and share data new strategies will be needed for sourcing analyzing and sharing vast quantities of data immediate steps that need to be taken to support this process start with the commitment of all partners to support the open sharing of data and learning in real time to support rapid cycle agricultural innovation the g leaders have recently signed an open data charterv which should be embraced by all countries and thus also become a key measure for supporting agricultural development governments and institutions will need to translate this into policies and incentives that ensure the timely release of important data so that new insights can be extracted to further accelerate agricultural development and also support cross sector exchange with health environment and finance all of which affect the lives of the rural poor a new paradigm is needed to reward public as well as private organizations who share research data with the broader community while acknowledging and appreciating their intellectual contribution this is a complex challenge to face over the next years but it is one we must collectively own and implement if we are to realize the vision of sustainable agriculture we hope that soon there will be a coordinated global network of measurement activities that includes critical biophysical socioeconomic and nutritional metrics v the g open data charter signed june is available at www gov uk government uploads system uploads attachment data file open data charter pdf other useful tools can be deployed to analyze trends and inform the public policy makers and other actors for making the right decisions many useful composite indices or decision and communication tools have been proposed in recent years to score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems annex composite indices and user friendly decision tools cannot replace the specific indicators needed to measure progress towards achieving targets and sdgs but they can be valuable additional tools for policy guidance and decision making communication education and concrete action they are particularly valuable for engaging stakeholders at different levels and scales including at local level along the whole value chain and support system solutions available for action context specific solutions that transcend small to large scale farming and food systems farming systems are complex and highly heterogeneous at all scales from regional and national to village or farm so too are farming objectives solutions and tradeoffs strategies for sai must provide viable options for farms that can produce substantial surpluses as wells as for those small farms that support the livelihood of millions of rural people the specific policies and technology solutions for implementing sai largely depend on the socioeconomic and biophysical contexts under which farmers currently operate with resource endowment and market access being two main drivers across different scales fig many other factors diversify households size social status religion tribe caste education etc but many of these are also linked to resource endowment and market access different solutions are required for large farms with good market access and high input use small farms with good market access and high input use small farms with weak market access and low input use or larger farms with poor market access figure resource endowment and access to markets are key determinants for tailoring different solutions to the local context to overcome current constraints and establish better business models for agriculture the real new challenge is to move to better business models by choice beyond thousands of poor smallholders by default at the core of devising solutions lies a thorough understanding of the socioeconomic and biophysical factors that drive the needs of farmers agri businesses small entrepreneurs consumers and many other actors we need to characterize and segment the market in order to target technologies and policies and then market better technologies efficiently through modern delivery systems countries need to move away from subjective mapping of factors of theorized importance to a rigorous definition of development and business domains based on quantitative data for resource endowment and market access solutions need to be flexible in terms of offering a suite of technologies and support systems provided by different sectors in a complementary mode with a particular emphasis on business driven models different paradigms are required for different regions box farmers who are blessed with large landholdings and other capital good market access and support systems and the capacity to use farm inputs like irrigation purchased fertilizer and other agricultural inputs can produce the large surplus yields that keep food prices low such farmers like their counterparts with smaller farms may be vulnerable to rising energy costs insofar as irrigation fertilizer and transport to market are dependent on fossil fuels technologies that allow them to increase yields and the efficiency of cost intensive inputs or substitute them partially will increase their profitability and reduce the potential damage done to the environment box the paradigm of sai in african smallholder agriculture food production in sub saharan africa is not keeping pace with food demand yield gaps are large and pervasive in african smallholder agriculture for almost all crops in all regions at present most smallholder farmers are unable to benefit from potential yield gains offered by plant genetic improvement challenges faced include lack of access to water nutrients quality seeds and other inputs small landholdings poor soil quality and lack of capital to invest in improving soils coupled with intense labor demands caused by lack of mechanization timely and better quality field management is impeded irrigation mechanization and local seed production of crops that have economical value for farmers are among the key improvements needed for increasing agricultural production in sub saharan africa but they need to go hand in hand with better agronomy continued cropping without sufficient addition of nutrients and organic matter leads to soil degradation rendering many soils non responsive to seeds fertilizers and other inputs this lack of response constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many small farmers in africa given the poor agricultural productivity of only t ha of cereal grain across much of sub saharan africa the primary goal is to increase crop productivity per unit of resource invested through carefully targeted interventions across scales little can be gained by trying to raise the genetic yield potential when current yields are or less of what is achievable but much can be gained by improving the genetic adaptation to local stress complexes and combining these traits with those preferred by farmers and consumers an important fraction of the yield gap can be reduced through better agronomy irrigation planting dates spacing cultivars early weeding etc even when only microdoses of fertilizers can be applied sound agronomic management is a prerequisite for efficient use of quality seeds irrigation and nutrients many african smallholder farmers already practice their own forms of precision farming by recognizing soil fertility gradients in their farms and fields and allocating crops and resources differently this knowledge combined with scientific knowledge simple diagnostic tools such as soil test kits or leaf color charts and solid policy support can form the basis for a broader sai framework and its local adaptation and implementation in sub saharan africa it needs to focus on targeted best fit approaches from a portfolio of options rather than pushing best bet or silver bullet approaches on the other hand globally there are over million small family farmsw most of which are mixed farms producing crops and livestock half of the worlds cereals are produced in these small scale mixed farms smallholder farmers are often at a disadvantage in terms of available resources and accessing markets they rely substantially on self provisioning it is difficult for a farming family to make a better living from growing crops or raising a few animals on a half hectare plot with few inputs and unsophisticated technologies unable to reach the market not all small scale farmers can become large scale farmers but some form of aggregation of primary production and support services will be required in order to take advantage of new markets and technologies and to transform farming into an attractive local business and job opportunity in many developing and emerging economies where youth make up of the population and youth and womens unemployment is a serious issue new visions of smallholder farming with enhanced societal value and respect would provide a deliberate platform for generating employment opportunities and reducing migration from rural areas to urban centers all farmers need to be moved towards good access to inputs markets information and other supporting services fig strategies that provide the needed support base as well as timely market information w farms two hectares or less in size this includes some million small farms in india and china alone would lower the barriers for participating in domestic and export markets such mechanisms include i formation of cooperatives or growers associations to increase their collective ability for effective negotiation sharing of the cost of inputs more efficient dissemination of new ideas and market information to farmers and reduction of cost of certification ii participation in outgrower schemes organized by centralized agribusinesses where the smallholder provides land and labor in exchange for technical assistance credit inputs infrastructural support and market knowledge iii access to high value crop options niche markets and the necessary information and technologies for successful production and iv regional initiatives which help to disseminate technologies increase smallholders market leverage and coordinate reliable supplies governments civil society the private sector and international agencies must work together with local extension services and farmers to support the tailoring of sai solutions to farmers needs by improving diagnosis understand the context in which an effort or an intervention will be implemented and its links to the best available scientific and local knowledge contextualized principles identify the right economic social and ecological principles of relevance to farmers needs getting it right locally empower local communities to improve the performance of the farming system or value chain based on scientific principles and local preferences scaling and support expand the scope of the effort or intervention in terms of numbers of people involved and the size of the territory and create the necessary value chains services support systems and self sustained business models evidence monitor and document the performance and learn to enrich the local national and global knowledge base to influence policies that will support further implementation solutions for early action practical solutions for transforming world agriculture need to address innovation markets people and political leadership solutions need to enable concrete action for change towards meeting one or more of the targets defined in chapter sharp focus must remain on solutions for poverty reduction and improving the livelihoods of rural households and communities including more resilient crop and livestock systems that can stand extreme heat drought floods and other climatic extremes small scale food production offers a direct route to ending hunger and malnutrition and reducing poverty but small producers especially if incentivized by having land tenure are also an army of potential environmental stewards that can help protect natural resources and ecosystem services better than governments or large companies small farmers service providers processors marketers and other local entrepreneurs must be central to any investment and policy strategy that enables the development and widespread adoption of new solutions equal weight needs to be given to interventions at the farm level and solutions for improving post harvest food chains all the way to the consumer new opportunities exist for solutions that combine food industry and agribusiness development with the food security poverty alleviation and environmental agenda the domestic private sector composed of millions of farmers and other local businesses is by far the biggest investor in agriculture goals for sustainable agriculture and food production can only be achieved if domestic governments and the international community create an enabling environment that enhances sustainable and inclusive private investment in agriculture this also requires full participation by the business community in international national and local platforms that aim to implement the new sustainable development agenda for small farmers to be able to step up to a higher level key challenges to overcome include securing control over land water and other critical resources and gaining access to better infrastructure inputs knowledge and markets early solutions need to focus on critical areas where improvements in crop livestock and fish productivity and environmental performance can be made relatively quickly although crop and livestock productivity gaps vary greatly worldwide they are particularly large in sub saharan africa south asia and some other developing regions in many of these countries or regions within countries significant gains in productivity and resource efficiency are possible through better seeds irrigation nutrient management and other agronomic measures policy measures have a huge impact on the success of such early actions for example instead of flat subsidies that encourage inefficient water use or groundwater depletion variable policy tools could include better measurement of water consumption variable pricing of electricity for irrigation cross subsidizing small holders with revenue from large holders or targeted support for new technologies that result in higher water use efficiency without a reduction in crop yields on the other hand opportunities for improving the environmental performance of agriculture are largest in countries such as china where input use is already high and often inefficient particularly with regard to water fertilizers pesticides and energy people are the primary agents of change they must be at the center of solutions for concrete action at national to local scales on one hand we need to strive to change the behavior of everyone from the food producer to the consumer including politicians and business executives on the other hand we need to provide new opportunities for people women and youth in particular to become part of a new sustainable development movement through attractive job opportunities that requires equipping people with the knowledge skills new tools and information needed to enact change an important way to solve problems is through practical initiatives involving new technologies business models institutional mechanisms and or policies that are promising for early action can take place in any country and can also generate learning elsewhere they need to address various components of sai and its enabling systems fig but many are connected and must be integral parts of a systematic approach to sai from food production to consumption box many solutions will have to be integrated initiatives designed and implemented in a specific development or landscape context in response to the most relevant national and local challenge domains for agriculture nevertheless we should also recognize those few interventions or innovations that could indeed trigger transformative changes in farming or a whole food chain over a relatively short period below we provide examples of solutions for early action i e interventions that could be of high priority for many countries in the coming to years we do not aim to provide simple recipes or policy strategies with specific priorities for countries or regions instead our examples are a basket of options for countries to consider and adapt to their specific needs they can be further prioritized and customized based on cross sectoral benefits scalability and wide applicability novelty feasibility learning by doing comprehensive vetting and sponsorship countries need to be committed to implement these solutions themselves but with support as required from other countries and international agencies technology spillover and many forms of between cross country and cross regional learning should play a major role in guiding countries and helping them to move faster international action networks such as the sdsn will promote selected solutions initiatives for early stage demonstration development and scaling up box ten key actions for improving nutrient use efficiency in food systems improving the full chain nutrient use efficiency nue of nitrogen and phosphorus defined as the ratio of nutrients in final products to new nutrient inputs is a central element in meeting the challenge to produce more food and energy with less pollution and better use of available nutrient resources nutrient flow is a cycle from resources through stages of use blue arrows and recycling green arrows the system is driven by the motors of human consumption red which are thus also a key part of the solutions needed for achieving future nutrient targets the poorest need to be allowed to increase their food and other nutrient consumption while the richest must realize that it is not in their own interest to over consume there are significant differences in the cycles of nitrogen phosphorus or other nutrients among and within countries that need to be taken into account in determining specific targets and interventions hence the targets for nutrient use and nue will vary among countries and so will the pathways for achieving them by addressing any of the specific components of the full chain nue relative to their current state possible actions include numbers in the graph improve nue in crop production improve nue in animal production increase the fertilizer equivalence value of animal manure low emission combustion and energy efficient systems develop nox capture and utilization technology improve efficiency in the fertilizer and food supply and reduce food waste recycle n and p from waste water systems energy and transport saving lower personal consumption of animal protein and spatial and temporal optimization of nutrient flows of the solutions proposed the first three are directly related to agricultural systems management specific targets and indicators can be defined for each of these steps center for ecology and hydrology global partnership on nutrient management ini edinburgh source fig sutton m a et al our nutrient world the challenge to produce more food and energy with less pollution new productive crop varieties for the poor main contributions targets a a b a crop yield growth rates in many smallholder farms remain too low and farmers often experience periods of food or income insecurity due to yield losses caused by abiotic and biotic stresses every farmer should have access to affordable quality seed from a wide range of well adapted crop varieties or hybrids through government private sector and community seed systems enhanced breeding methods such as marker assisted precision breeding or genetic engineeringx can be deployed to speed up the rate of genetic gain shorten the time it takes to develop new varieties and breed new varieties more precisely for specific environments and market segments thus better meeting farmers needs this requires investments to transform public and private sector breeding pipelines of major food crops into faster more efficient product oriented breeding pipelines full advantage can now be taken of wider genetic diversity genome sequence information genome wide molecular markers low cost genotyping platforms rapid generation advancement breeding population development technologies better phenotyping and variety testing methods and breeding information management tools box stress tolerant rice varieties as a climate smart solution for the poor the international rice research institute irri and its national partners in asia are developing a new generation of rice varieties that are tolerant to submergence drought heat salinity and combinations of those in the early s using a flood tolerant landrace from eastern india scientists at irri and the university of california davis discovered a major locus on chromosome of the rice genome later called the sub gene that allows rice to endure complete submergence for up to weeks thus greatly reducing the risk of flood damage which threatens million hectares of lowland areas in asia subsequent fine mapping of the gene and progress in dna marker technology enabled marker assisted breeding of high yielding rice varieties with flood tolerance and yield advantages of t ha demonstrated in farmers fields the first new variety swarna sub was developed in followed by official release in quality seed was rapidly multiplied and disseminated through a large network of over hundred public civil society and private sector partners in india bangladesh and nepal supported by national policy makers and international donors by about million rice farmers in these three countries grew the new flood tolerant rice similar approaches are being applied to breeding drought tolerant rice showing consistently large yield advantages of t ha new breeding products combine drought with submergence tolerance heat with drought tolerance or submergence with salt tolerance through marker assisted selection which will provide free crop insurance for farmers intellectual property regimes and national variety release guidelines need to be modernized harmonized and incentivized to rapidly release new varieties and encourage investment in breeding and seed businesses seed laws and policies need to enable and support a vibrant public and private seed system including many small and medium size companies and seed producer groups well coordinated global crop improvement networks can further accelerate progress in genetic gain by increasing the resolution and precision of environmental information working across key domains and hotspots for a range of biotic abiotic and socio economic constraints and sharing knowledge genetic and other resources in open source breeding platforms countries with insufficient breeding capacity would gain from progress being made in other countries thus enabling farmers worldwide to increase yields and reduce the risk of yield losses due to drought high temperatures flooding salinity diseases and x marker assisted selection is a conventional breeding method in which the selection process is accelerated by detecting the presence of desired traits dna sequences through molecular markers or whole genome analysis in contrast genetic modification gm involves the direct transfer of genes from one organism to another including genes from other species insect pests among the most successful examples so far has been the development and deployment of a new generation of stress tolerant varieties for rainfed lowland rice areas in asia and africa box more nutritious staple food crops main contributions targets a c a few staple food crops dominate the food intake of billion people suffering from undernourishment caused by iron zinc vitamin a and other deficiencies achieving better nutritional balance involves a wide range of measures diversification of agricultural systems crops livestock and fish products external mineral and vitamin supply optimal feeding and caring practices breeding of more nutritious crops agronomic biofortification and other measures supplementation programs or the promotion of home gardens or livestock and fish have limits in terms of reaching all of the poor many do not even have the land or other resources to grow their own more nutritious food while the health benefits of a balanced diet are clear biofortification the enrichment of staple food crops with micronutrients vitamin a or other enhanced nutritional traits through breeding or fertilizers is another effective strategy for overcoming specific nutritional deficiencies in rural populations in developing countries it reaches down to the lowest income levels and elevates the base level of nutrient intake thus also making many other interventions more successful and helping to eradicate hidden hunger by even small increases in the protein mineral or vitamin content of staple crops can make a significant difference in nutrition and health significant progress has been made in recent years to breed more nutritious food crops through both conventional breeding and genetic modification gm promising examples include vitamin a enriched sweet potatoes orange sweet potato rice golden rice maize and cassava high zinc rice and wheat and high iron beans pearl millet and rice several conventional varieties have already been released and the results of efficacy and effectiveness studies have confirmed substantial nutrition benefits countries civil society and international agencies should take measures to accelerate progress in breeding release and distribution of biofortified crop varieties breeding programs need to include nutrition traits in their standard product profiles and variety evaluation schemes so that nutrition traits become part of mainstream breeding this is a departure from the past focus on long shelf life standard color and shape which is often achieved at the expense of nutritional content as there is often a trade off between the various traits breeders need to take full advantage of new genomics biotechnology and breeding technologies to achieve quantum leaps in micronutrient and vitamin enrichment of food crops targeting the poor deployment of these varieties through local seed systems needs to be accelerated to ensure that quality seed is available and affordable in addition to breeding micronutrient fertilization is another highly successful strategy to fortify crops agronomically by adding zinc selenium or iodine to conventional fertilizer blends it is possible to not only boost productivity through yield gains but also to eradicate deficiencies in humans new models for agricultural extension main contributions targets a a b b a many unexploited income productivity and resource efficiency gaps can be closed through accelerating the transfer of new knowledge and technologies enhancing access by farmers to markets and information facilitating better interaction among farmers and knowledge providers and assisting farmers and small businesses to develop their own technical organizational and management skills and practices this is the essence of good agricultural extension and it has been the driving force for productivity enhancements in many developed countries in crop production for example it requires systematically implementing programs aimed at improving farmers skills in practices such as cropping systems choice land preparation choosing the right seed planting water and nutrient management control of pests diseases and weeds machine operation harvest and postharvest operations record keeping farm business management and information technology throughout the world every farmer should have access to good quality extension and advisory services provided by the public sector private companies or consultants ngos or farmer organizations all of them can play complementary roles unfortunately agricultural extension systems in most low and medium income countries are weak both in term of outreach capacity and the quality of service provided they often lack incentive schemes and mechanisms for professional training for agricultural advisory workers different sectors rarely work together demand driven pluralistic advisory and extension systems with motivated skilled professionals and effective use of modern information communication technologies ict will be required for making sai a reality in every farm depending on the most appropriate local extension model professional crop advisers government extension agents farmer facilitators community knowledge workers as well as sellers of agricultural inputs need to become trusted expert contacts for farmers a new generation of agricultural knowledge workers must have the necessary technical interpersonal and communication skills professional certification and continued education means of transport technical backstopping and more they also need to have clear incentives to help farmers succeed to both generate new knowledge and provide local agriculture solutions for farmers they need to have strong links to and understanding of adaptive research within relevant agro ecologies they also need to be in full command of soft facilitation skills modern decision tools and information technologies mobile smart phones internet social media participatory video remote sensing soil and weather data etc realizing this vision will require transformative institutional changes of current agricultural extension systems in most countries including a greater role for the private sector as well as complementary changes in agricultural research especially greater capacity in adaptive research linked to extension capacity many new models are currently being piloted first lessons are being compiled by global and regional platforms for rural advisory systems such as meas www meas extension org meas offers case studies or gfras www g fras org en innovations include demand driven and market oriented mechanisms to link farmers more directly to improved technology new business models and product markets such as the china agriculture extension special task force or fips africa http fipsafrica org in which self employed village based advisors also participate in profit sharing schemes with farmers following a multi technology approach such practitioners must have good command of both technical and entrepreneurial skills there is also significant potential for linking agricultural extension with other sectors for example nutrition and health education finance and government services the key to success will be to create scalable self sustained business models in which a new generation of proud and skilled agriculture professionals can earn a good living by serving farmers entrepreneurs and others involved in agricultural value chains nutrient management and stewardship from science to local solutions main contributions targets a a b b a improving nutrient management is a central element in meeting the challenge to increase food production increase farm incomes improve soil quality reduce nutrient losses to the environment and protect natural ecosystems both governments and businesses play an important role in this process science based principles for integrated site specific use of fertilizers organic materials and other nutrient sources have been developed through research site specific nutrient management in crops such as rice wheat and maize has shown large benefits in terms of yield farm profit increased nitrogen use efficiency and better nutrient balances mobile phone and web applications have been developed in many countries e g nm rice www irri org nmrice integrated soil fertility management isfm strategies that make use of mineral for use by extension workers and farmers fertilizers and locally available organic amendments but also promote other good management practices are a key to increasing agricultural productivity and improving poor soils in sub saharan africa countries businesses and international donors should invest in solutions initiatives that seek to systematically increased crop production sustainability and associated benefits such as the r nutrient stewardship programs box improve nutrient management for crop yield profitability and environmental performance r nutrient implementation of regionally specific best management practices box r nutrient stewardship enhanced nutrient stewardship plays a critical role in increasing crop production and sustainability it is the foundation for improving farm incomes and in turn improving food and nutritional security education healthcare local employment and environmental investments in cases of low nutrient use efficiency and higher crop production it supports grower efforts to increase crop uptake of nutrients while continuing to increase stewardship www nutrientstewardship com provides an action framework for improving the economic social and environmental performance of nutrient use applying the right source of plant nutrients at the right rate time and place within a cropping system is the basis for nutrient stewardship these four rights are necessary for sustainable management of plant nutrients using both organic and inorganic amendments and when used with other agronomic best management practices e g improved seed planting density etc allow growers to achieve economic social and environmental goals performance improvement goals are specific to the region increased yield improved nutrient use efficiency reduced runoff and leaching etc and are achieved through involves participatory learning through continuous assessment of impacts and feedback from researchers extension workers and growers in a process of iterative enhancements improving nutrient use among farmers supports local and regional activities on improving environmental goods and services such as water quality but also strengthens local agri businesses that provide inputs dispense agronomic advice and support the local economy model sites are being established in north america within key watersheds to advance nutrient stewardship programming and a research fund has been established to advance the system in kenya a model site has been established to create a r nutrient stewardship system and enabling extension for small maize producers the system will be implemented in pilot areas with the goal of increasing yields improving soil quality and supporting the development of agribusiness an iterative implementation and scaling model will be used to customize the solution to regional and local needs using model sites all information will be open source allowing interested stakeholders to adopt and adapt the solution to their local situation additional private and public partners are being sought to expand pilot sites extension staffing and expert farmer programming but also scale up to include new crops other best management practices and the use of digital technologies to support local adoption and the sharing of information globally implementation micro irrigation for smallholder farmers main contributions targets a a c many smallholder farms in sub saharan africa asia and other regions are trapped in poverty and experience periods of food insecurity due to low cropping intensity and productivity caused by water stress irrigation is a key entry point for doubling or tripling crop yields and enabling diversification of cropping systems large scale irrigation systems are capital intensive and restricted to lowland areas with suitable conditions solar powered drip or other micro irrigation technologies on the other hand can be customized to meet the needs of small farmers operating in diverse environments with limited capital micro irrigation systems precisely deliver water nutrients and other inputs directly to the root zone resulting in high yields and high efficiency of these inputs equipped with additional filters these systems can also supply clean drinking water smart metered local solar and wind power utility models can provide the electricity needed for irrigation pumps as well as local households schools and small village enterprises including processing or storing of food demonstrated impacts include improved food security and nutrition increased incomes reduced poverty and new local business opportunities and jobs modern low pressure drip or other micro irrigation systems are modular and can be designed to meet varying local needs ranging from a small family plot to village or community scale production a stage wise introduction and scaling up strategy includes a thorough analysis of the biophysical and socioeconomic environment for technology design and business model development financing business development training of farmers and professionals and linkages to input suppliers and markets solutions for harvesting rainwater or accessing and storing available surface and groundwater water need to be adapted to the local situation young agricultural professionals and technicians need to be trained and have the right incentives to provide professional services to farmers as a business to minimize risk and enhance food security drip irrigated intensified cropping systems should include staple food crops and crops with high nutritional and market value e g vegetables fruits intensive diverse all year round cropping is scheduled by the local community according to water and electricity needs by different crops and users farmers may also form new cooperatives or other small enterprises through which drip irrigation agriculture is done contract farming can become an integral part of such new value chains services maintenance and inputs are provided by local utility and service company professionals supported by public sector research and extension workers local workshops for small machinery pumps repair and maintenance can create additional jobs implementation requires low interest capital from various sources as well as financing through pay per use models for both electricity and water smartphones linked to the internet provide access to real time weather and market information and are also used for real time water and electricity monitoring and customer management contract tracking billing and payments investing in livestock markets main contributions targets a c a livestock account for of agricultural gdp in developing countries and four of the five highest traded agricultural commodities are livestock products but the sector underperforms in terms of its contribution to food security poverty reduction and livelihoods of smallholder producers by investing now in the promotion of livestock enterprises and value chain development national governments and the donor community could pave the way for the emergence of a livestock industry that will sustainably respond to national food security needs while staying inclusive of small livestock keepers national livestock strategies promoting enterprise and value chain development should address four main constraints strengthening the institutions governing livestock product value chains foster the emergence of livestock commodity associations where representatives from all the stakeholders in particular commodity chains sit together to resolve common problems for the whole chain the south african red meat industry forum is a successful example of this consolidating the enabling environment for livestock businesses this includes a developing and enforcing a legal framework for livestock sector businesses b development of appropriate road electricity water information and communication technologies and slaughtering and market infrastructures c facilitation of international trade by for example promoting itinerant customs controls across the country rather than only at ports of entry and aligning trade regulations across countries d strengthening animal health systems and e setting up livestock product quality and safety standards which are adapted to the countrys situation and its smallholder farmers and which are also trustworthy for regional foreign buyers implementing targeted public incentives to encourage investment in livestock enterprises establish a government investment fund targeting the livestock sector and which can contribute to funding investment activities by farmers smes and larger agro industries and to help secure loans from private banks or microfinance institutions developing the business management capacities of livestock value chain stakeholders livestock sector development will not happen without capacity building of smallholder farmers and smes in business and enterprise management sharing of innovations across the livestock product and other agricultural value chains is also essential for market led agricultural extension and supply chain management public extension services are often not well equipped to implement such capacity development activities effectively but public funds can help increase the budget of ngos industry bodies and farmers organizations to implement capacity development activities that are in line with wider livestock sector development objectives agreed upon by the whole industry in a consultative process livestock vaccines main contributions targets a c a medical and veterinary vaccine inventions are among the most cost effective disease control interventions ever deployed they have enabled the global eradication of two lethal diseases e g smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle and wild ungulates vaccines against livestock diseases have the power to reduce livestock mortality sustainably increase productivity increase food and nutritional security enhance the livelihoods of the poor and help developing economies grow extensive quarantine diagnosis and slaughter of livestock are not sustainable disease control options in developing countries vaccines are essential in preventing the spread of disease diseases of tropical origin are now threatening developed countries for example african swine fever has reached europe and is threatening the pig industry there despite the importance of vaccines many of the diseases that affect livestock in developing countries are neglected there is an under investment in this critical area of livestock agriculture the situation is exacerbated by a general lack of capacity to undertake early phase research in developing countries and a lack of biotechnology related enterprises priority livestock diseases include african swine fever asf contagious bovine pleuropneumonia cbpp east coast fever ecf peste de petits ruminants ppr and rift valley fever rvf the latter is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from livestock to people live pathogen based vaccines exist against cbpp ecf ppr and rvf for asf there is no vaccine and preventing the spread of virus is the only realistic method of disease control although the existing vaccines are often sub optimal in nature and require cold chain facilities for delivery they can be used until more effective vaccines are developed with advances in molecular techniques investment in the development of a new generation of subunit vaccines and vaccines that are thermostable could have huge rewards in the next years this would also help spawn a new generation of scientists to continue battling on the front lines of the ever evolving arms race between health and disease doubling animal productivity with better use of crop residues main contributions targets a c a crop residues such as straws stover and haulms form the basal diet of hundreds of millions of livestock in smallholder systems throughout developing countries these feeds have low to moderate nutritional value but even moderate improvements in their quality have substantial effects on livestock productivity a one percent increase in digestibility results in to increase in livestock outputs in most crops different cultivars have different nutritive values for example digestibility varies in cowpea sorghum pearl millet and groundnut by to percentage units and in rice straw by percentage units these differences can be exploited when farmers choose cultivars with better nutritive value without detriment to grain or pod yields fodder traders are well aware of these important differences in nutritive value for example in sorghum stover traded in india a one percent difference in digestibility was associated with a price difference of feeding trials showed that feeding sorghum stover with a digestibility of compared to as part of a mixed diet increased daily milk yield in buffaloes from to kg studies of the indian dairy industry show that improving the basal diets of crop residues coupled with feed processing and fortification could double the milk yield per animal without requiring more grain that can be directly used for human consumption with the rising availability of fast cheap laboratory methods all new varieties of crops should be screened for nutritive value of crop residues and this information made available to farmers along with data on yield disease resistance etc so that they can make informed choices about the varieties that they select for growing indian sorghum breeders have pioneered this approach with nutritive value of crop residues being one of the criteria used for release of new varieties extension of this to the release criteria of crops in other national programs should be a priority fodder quality traits such as digestibility and nitrogen content should be incorporated into crop improvement programs this can be done without impacting grain yield targeted genetic enhancement for food and feed fodder traits using recurrent selection hybridization marker assisted selection and qtl identification and backcrossing should be mainstreamed into crop breeding include a implementation of sustainable climate smart agriculture main contributions targets a a b c climate smart agriculture is not a single specific agricultural technology or practice that can be universally applied it is an approach that requires site specific assessments to identify suitable agricultural technologies and practices that aim to increase productivity in an environmentally and socially sustainable way strengthen farmers resilience to climate change and reduce agriculture s contribution to climate change by reducing ghg emissions and sequestering more carbon typical csa investment areas land management practices e g conservation agriculturey agroforestry integrated livestock management and water harvesting b climate risk management e g drought tolerant varieties early warning systems climate forecasts and use of ict tools for disseminating weather information and c transformation of whole production systems innovative policy instruments and financing mechanisms that link investments from the public and private sectors are key components for implementation csa includes activities that communities villages districts and higher government levels can take for example to provide a back up in case of crop or animal production failures implementing csa approaches is often challenging partly due to a lack of tools technology and data especially down scaled weather data to support the integration of multiple interventions at the farm level climate smart interventions are highly location specific and knowledge intensive considerable efforts are required to develop the knowledge and capacities of a wide range of stakeholders rainfall is y most efforts to date in developing countries have promoted conservation agriculture as a package of three practices minimum disturbance of soil zero minimum or reduced tillage retention of sufficient crop residue to provide surface coverage and diversified cropping patterns that usually also include a legume except for north and south america widespread adoption of this package has not yet occurred but there is evidence for adoption of one or two of these components in some areas in sub saharan africa or south asia low rainfall events and trigger payments one such example often the greatest production risk farmers face instruments to manage this risk include weather index insurance drought tolerant and water efficient varieties conservation agriculture practices water harvesting and supplemental irrigation technologies new commercial micro insurance models are emerging that hold promise when integrated with input credit programs and local weather stations to validate is the kilimo salama http kilimosalama wordpress com program in western kenya that uses an existing mobile money platform to make payments to eligible customers the integration of satellite radar and local automated reporting rain gages will be critical to support weather indexed credit and insurance in the masagro http masagro mx index php en program in mexico federal and state agencies are aligning policies and incentives to enhance the adoption of conservation agriculture practices for wheat and maize production for increased productivity and resilience to weather variability especially rainfall another example are policies that provide incentives to reduce ghg emissions associated with rice in vietnam increasing resilience to pests and diseases main contributions targets a a a as cropping systems intensify the potential for losses due to insects diseases and weeds together termed pests hereafter will increase if it is not actively managed this may be exacerbated by the increased climate variability that is predicted over the next four decades which could favor the rapid buildup of pests and disease populations pest risk will be compounded by increased movement of humans food and natural products among countries over the past four decades integrated pest management ipm http pesticidestewardship org ipm has emerged as a widely accepted approach to manage pests using host plant resistance combined with cultural biological and chemical control methods genetic resistance can be effective at the variety population and landscape levels in reducing risk related to pests and other stressors when resistance is built into the genetics of the crop or livestock variety it is easily replicated and distributed to and among farmers breeding resistance traits into commercial crops and livestock has become more effective with the advent of modern molecular tools that enable scientists to identify the different versions of a gene called alleles responsible for resistance and track their integration with other resistance traits into a single variety for some pests natural diversity does not provide adequate control which may require genetic engineering solutions for most pests however natural diversity for resistance exists and can be utilized through breeding and population management cultural controls include crop rotation management intercropping agronomic practices that improve the health of the plant or animal to naturally resist or tolerate attack or the management of habitat reservoirs new ecological engineering approaches aim to support populations of biological control agents that can regulate pest populations below economic damage levels one example of this is the push pull mechanism used in kenya to control stemborers and striga in maize desmodium a perennial legume is intercropped with maize to push or repel stemborers and to suppress striga and napier grass is planted outside the field to pull or attract stemborers away from the maize crop both desmodium and napier are valuable fodder crops for the kenyan smallholder dairy industry given the knowledge intensive nature of many ipm practices few examples of wide scale sustained adoption exist however icts are now improving access by researchers and extension agents to pest and disease diagnostic tools along with improved population modeling and weather data ipm is now well positioned to leverage digital platforms to support frontline extension agents and farmers in implementing preemptive management practices improved weather data will be required especially for regions with the most dramatic weather variability ict tools and community based crop clinics such as the plantwise initiative of cabi www plantwise org and its partners are already offering improved access to a growing knowledge base for pest and disease management solutions policies that support integrated approaches to pest and disease control will be important to avoid the unintended consequences experienced years ago with the introduction and over reliance on synthetic pesticides as a silver bullet for control most importantly input suppliers extension professionals and farmers need to be trained well in all aspects of modern pest management including pesticide stewardship www croplife org crop protection stewardship to minimize environmental or health risks innovative smallholder technologies to increase crop value reduce postharvest losses and improve food safety main contributions targets a a because farmers are often unable to dry store and process their produce losses are high and there is widespread contamination of foodstuffs with microbes and mycotoxins for example most vegetables and high value food crops are at peak quality at harvest but start to deteriorate soon afterwards moisture loss and physical damage during harvest packing storage and transportation causes losses of the loss of produce volume nutritional content and quality mean that consumers pay more for products which are less beneficial to their nutritional security reducing postharvest losses of these products will increase the incomes of the producers and the availability of micronutrients for all for starchy staples such as root tuber and cereal crops as well as for many legumes proper drying and storage is also critical to avoid the buildup of toxic compounds such as aflatoxin and fumonisin which are produced by molds various postharvest handling methods are already available to help deliver more produce of better quality to the point of sale the methods reduce moisture loss and physical damage at every step along the chain from field and harvest to consumers growers should use the most appropriate crops to withstand the local environment transportation and market challenges these varieties must be well adapted to biotic and abiotic constraints and have morphological and physiological traits to assure the produce reaches the consumer in optimum condition and is acceptable best practices must be used harvest at optimum maturity and at cooler times of the day and keep produce in the shade to reduce temperature and moisture loss use harvesting tools and storage containers that do not inflict unnecessary damage to the produce grade the produce to remove damage or diseased materials to minimize microbial spoilage and clean and pack into uniform lots to attract higher prices in many developing countries keeping produce cool is a big challenge simple evaporative coolers are already available and mechanisms to adapt air conditioners to reduce temperatures further have been developed other postharvest techniques which can suit smallholder producers are various drying techniques to retain quality and improve shelf life modified atmosphere packaging and food processing to increase shelf life retain nutrients and add value to reduce postharvest losses growers and processors must be able to know what economic losses occur and are avoidable the information must help guide stakeholders in both the public and private sectors to identify constraints and opportunities active participation of all stakeholders is needed to identify the best postharvest management packages policy constraints also need to be addressed all in the context of delivering safe health promoting foods to consumers with minimal wastage preferred postharvest practices must be validated profitable technologies will encourage confidence among the growers and value chain actors to adopt the technologies further mechanisms for adding value may include certification further cleaning and produce sanitation and preparation of vegetables ready for cooking to meet the needs of busy urban consumers who need to save time in food preparation centers of excellence for postharvest management may be an ideal mechanism to provide necessary advice services tools and materials to empower growers and other actors along the value chain to make greater positive impact on their health and livelihoods by delivering more and better quality produce new business models for smallholder farming and marketing main contributions targets a a c c where structural transformation processes in urban and rural areas proceed rapidly traditional smallholder farming will more and more be supplemented or replaced with outsourcing of farming operations the formation of small and medium size farmer cooperatives or agribusiness enterprises and contract farming value chains for major agricultural commodities will become more tightly integrated because processors and consumers demand more information and control over how food is being produced with supermarket chains playing a particularly important role for farmers this is a chance to connect with rapidly growing domestic and export markets and thus become more direct beneficiaries of competitive food systems the food industry in particular has increased investments in direct sourcing of agricultural produce from small farmers worldwide a trend that is expected to continue due to increasing industry and consumer demands for tracing food and meeting certified as well as non certified production standards e g good agricultural practice www globalgap org or the sai platform www saiplatform org many countries and businesses are now experimenting with such new forms of market oriented smallholder farming they are often linked to supermarkets and food processing chains and can lead to substantial income gains for the participating farmers as well as better access to inputs services and new technologies a quiet revolution towards more vertical integration of value chains is already occurring in many countries of asia where urban areas typically account for half the population and two thirds to three quarters of its food demand box structural and value chain transformations of this nature could become key vehicles for improving the income of small farmers creating attractive jobs in rural areas and providing affordable safe nutritious food to urban consumers they also provide entry points for reducing food waste particularly food which perishes between farm and market in the developing world they are opportunities for solutions that combine food industry and agribusiness development and market competitiveness with the food security and poverty alleviation agenda more and larger scale pilots are needed to develop inclusive and sustainable business models for such a transformation of smallholder farming including good compliance mechanisms box the quiet revolution in staple food value chains in asia transformational changes in rice and potato value chains are occurring in bangladesh india and china this includes a rapid rise of supermarkets modern cold storages large rice mills and commercialized small farmers using input intensive mechanized technologies although there is great heterogeneity in farm sizes and distribution of non land assets all farmers regardless of how small their plots are are commercializing and benefitting markets for farm machinery water and land are active through mobile phones farmers are much better informed on what how and for whom to produce in the midstream segments of the value chain driven by the private sector rice mills are modernizing and cold storage facilities for potatoes have expanded rapidly to meet the demands of new off season urban markets the rise of cold storage has brought higher incomes for potato farmers and all season access for potato consumers processors now buy directly from farmers so they can do their own branding and packaging as supermarkets have penetrated urban food retail shifting from loose unbranded staples to packaged branded staples with traceability in the supply chain off farm components of the value chains account for of the total margins in these new rice and potato chains illustrating the importance of increasing the productivity of processing storage and distribution of food digital agriculture main contributions all targets digital technologies will be a key enabler to grapple with the complexity of sai and taking it to scale mobile phones interactive radio video and internet can enable farmers to access location specific and timely recommendations that are actionable but also to contribute to gathering large scale datasets on the performance of agricultural options varieties planting dates etc crowd sourcing can help fill data gaps and thus improve the tailoring of recommendations mobile technologies in particular are a vehicle to not only integrate improved varieties agronomy and policies to support food systems but also as the mechanism to integrate other key services such as credit insurance education and health digitally enabled technologies can drive transparency that in turn supports accountability and ultimately leads to good governance an essential ingredient for development governments need to embrace the era of digitally enabled exchange of information and learning to accelerate the pace of development democratize information and empower farmers consumers and investors to make informed choices strong public private partnerships will be required to realize the full potential of digital technology along value chains examples of digital agriculture applications include national and sub national scorecards that track key indicators

targets to address the challenges of food insecurity persistent poverty climate change ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss successfully it is critical to move beyond zero sum strategies that solve one problem but exacerbate others integrated landscape management aims to realize synergies and reduce trade offs among these multiple objectives farmers and land managers around the world are reaching out across traditional sectoral boundaries to forge partnerships with conservation organizations local governments businesses and others to solve problems that are inter connected more than

science and knowledge systems for landscape solutions for people food and nature landscapes together to implement the transforming china s agriculture main contributions targets c a b c b a c china produces the bulk of its food on millions of tiny farms but hundreds of millions of people have already left the countryside in recent decades china also imports huge amounts of agricultural products from other regions success in transforming the global food system will also depend on whether china can transform its agriculture the sheer size of its population and food consumption and the rapid pace of its economic development have already strained land water and other resources leading to widespread environmental problems and food safety concerns sai will have to become the cornerstone for future food security and rural development in china perhaps the biggest challenge for china is to find double high sai solutions that ensure high yields with high resource use efficiency and also meet higher environmental protection and land quality standards being the world s largest fertilizer consumer more effective nutrient management is of particular significance for china because current application rates of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are high whereas their use efficiencies are often very low solving this problem requires better congruence between crop nutrient demand and nutrient supply from soil fertilizer and other sources the technologies and diagnostic tools needed have been developed by chinese researchers demonstrating that large gains in yields income water and nutrient use efficiency could be achieved adoption of such approaches could also lead to substantial reductions in ghg emissions nitrogen fertilizer related emissions constitute about of ghg emissions from the entire chinese economy mitigation opportunities include improving methane recovery during coal mining enhancing energy efficiency in fertilizer manufacture and increasing the efficiency of n fertilizer use at the field level this could cut n fertilizer related emissions by which would decrease chinas total ghg emissions by the main challenge is how to upscale knowledge intensive management practices through suitable policies and extension models for different types of farming in china in small households with ha land double high agriculture requires organizing small farms into somewhat larger land units and working closely with farmers through village based agricultural experts this should also be tied into new business models for farming in china such as small to medium agribusinesses cooperatives and contract farming in contrast large farms are found in northeast china with each household managing ha or more land with modern machinery and good access to professional extension experts in this case even information technology based management and large scale agricultural service models have been tested and successfully adopted by these large scale farms agricultural technology extension in china predominantly relies on public sector activities with only a small complementary role for the private sector with further development of the chinese economy the role of the private sector in research and extension of agriculture technology is becoming more important based on the characteristics of the main bodies involved in china the approaches for agricultural technology transfer and extension for high yield and high efficiency crop production can include farm based approaches for promoting knowledge transfer to farmers enterprise based approaches for incorporating knowledge into commercial products and government based approaches for improving the national extension network monitoring the worlds agricultural systems main contributions all targets effective monitoring networks are essential to track anticipate and manage changes in the biophysical economic and social aspects of different farming systems around the world a global agricultural monitoring system should be established as a well designed and well directed network of partners engaged in collecting high quality data required by a wide range of stakeholders it would provide up to date information on the status of agriculture and progress towards meeting the agreed future sdg targets including environmental targets affected by agriculture simultaneously measuring indicators across sdgs including many of those proposed in chapter in an integrated monitoring system will allow scientists land managers and other decision makers alike to find solutions to the most pressing problems facing global food security it would help direct public and private investments and would allow for quantification of the multifunctional aspects of agriculture and food systems in a comparable manner across scales such a monitoring system would build on existing but often disconnected monitoring efforts it would supplement and improve existing national and global statistics with high quality data collected at farm landscape and regional scales both universal and site specific metrics are needed to detect change over time and across scales this would include for example more precise data such as crop and livestock yields weather data so that yields can be adjusted for climate variability yield gaps based on simulation of yield potential and measurement of actual yields nutrient application rates budgets and efficiencies crop losses by pests and diseases water use and efficiency measures of soil quality and ecological resilience availability of credit and machinery household income and low cost genetic fingerprinting to assess the diversity of the main crop varieties and animal breeds it would utilize adaptive monitoring and hierarchical design strategies to address specific and new questions or hypotheses including those that are subject to much public debate such as the impacts of gm crops or tradeoffs of organic agriculture universities and international agricultural research centers the cgiar and others could play a major role in such an effort because they have thousands of experts in various disciplines and thousands of partners on the ground an interdisciplinary monitoring network would also provide unique exciting opportunities for students and others to learn about the science and practice of sustainable agriculture the monitoring work would have to tie in with national statistical agencies un agencies and others who collect and analyze data on agriculture and associated and natural ecosystems to overcome many of the current weaknesses in data coverage and quality see chapter international donors should allocate sufficient amounts of long term funding to support such an effort which would benefit them and countries in making better decisions and tracking returns on investments investing in long term change foresight is needed to avoid running into another food crisis or years from now in addition to investing in early solutions or technologies that are likely to become available in the next to years strategic investments are needed to sustain and even accelerate the rate of progress over time this requires large stable investments in two major areas agricultural research with potentially high payoffs and strengthening the capacity of national agricultural research systems nars including human resources development at all levels from science to extension for some years farming made progress through observation tinkering and trial and error organized agricultural research has only been conducted for about years its success has been spectacular leading to a steady accumulation of knowledge as well as massive breakthroughs in the performance of agriculture it has been demonstrated numerous times that rates of return on investment in agricultural r d are high in both developed and developing countriesz that spillover of innovations among countries is substantial and that investments in r d often have large long lasting cross sectoral growth benefits it has also been shown that countries that have heavily invested in r d extension and measures that favor long term business and infrastructure development for commercialization of new knowledge and technologies have also had the strongest productivity growth further investments in r d can have significant impacts on productivity growth even in the absence of improvements in infrastructure or extension whereas the reverse is usually not the case despite this track record and a modest increase in funding in recent years agricultural r d expenditures remain far too low in most countries in global public spending on agricultural r d totaled about us billion split about evenly between high income and low middle income countries private sector investments add another us billion of which is in high income countries altogether agriculture and food only account for about of total global science spending moreover brazil china and india alone account for half of all agricultural r d spending in the low medium income category whereas many low and middle income countries still have very limited r d capacity it has been estimated that nearly half of the world s agricultural science knowledge stock has been generated by just seven countries with the usa japan and china accounting for one third there is no plausible reason for why returns on investments in agricultural r d could be lower in the future investments in public agricultural research should be doubled within the next years and they need to be of a long term strategic nature not driven by short term thinking and bureaucracy that z annualized rates of return vary by country and type of innovation but often range from to in agricultural research in developing countries calculations of rates of return may sometimes be biased because failures may not be included in impact studies or because attribution to research is difficult to quantify for some technologies and policy interventions causes high transaction costs although private sector funding for agricultural r d has risen substantially in recent years questions must be raised as to whether it can really substitute for public r d generally speaking private sector r d is concentrated on fewer commodities technologies and markets than public r d and the intellectual property created is not equally accessible moreover a decline in public sector funding would also lead to a decline in basic research needed to create new technology opportunities for the private sector as well as a decline in the training of human resources needed by the private sector hence a balanced approach is needed including increased investments in public r d on agriculture and food systems but with better r d funding mechanisms that create more space for scientists to actually be able to do creative science larger more predictable and less restrictive support for r d involves investing in strong pipelines of both basic and applied research both are interlinked and need to be funded in parallel many exciting new ideas have been proposed or are already being pursued by research groups worldwide addressing fundamental questions in agricultural sciences most of them require large longer term public and private sector investment and effective collaboration of scientists worldwide some examples for potential future breakthroughs are shown in box investing in creating and retaining a new generation of agricultural scientists and professionals including more women will be vital for achieving any of the post agricultural goals huge human resource gaps persist in many developing countries particularly in sub saharan africa but with the exception of china and india also in most countries of asia a generation gap is opening up due to retirements and lacking investments in human resources development during the past years we can achieve a lot with new technologies but only if we have dedicated people who develop them make sure that they meet farmers and businesses needs and bring them towards application robots computers the internet or smartphones cannot do this they are helpful tools but not the primary means for innovation and enacting behavior change in the complex world of agriculture public science education on food agricultural and environmental issues needs to be strengthened all the way from primary education to college curricula should be upgraded to include the best available science of sustainable agricultural intensification in an exciting manner thus encouraging young people to become part of the transformative changes needed by seeking a career in the agriculture and food sectors a global classroom a network of knowledge centers who become global regional and national leaders in agricultural sustainability science and practice should be formed to raise the profile of agricultural science mobilize action connect young people worldwide and also educate business executives and political leaders national agricultural research systems nars aa are the backbone of agricultural development in a country but many will require a complete overhaul and even whole new models in order to be able to fulfill their mandate at present many are too weak in terms of human capital infrastructure operational funding incentives management and governance to undertake the work that will be required in many countries nars still depend highly on donor funding which also creates volatility risks for pursuing a long term national agenda while international donors should be encouraged to invest more in both international and national agricultural r d systems most low to middle income countries should also aim to spend at least of their agricultural gdp to support public agricultural r d in their country at present most developing countries spend only about of agricultural gdp on r d modernization of nars and greater financial support should be an integral component of comprehensive national agricultural development and investment strategies following an integrated aa here we focus primarily on public sector research the term national agricultural research and extension systems nares is often used to describe the entire system of research and extension organizations in a country inclusive approach that is country owned many good suggestions have been made and various new models have already been tried in recent years for modernizing national agricultural research as well as extension systems box blue sky research that could lead to future transformative changes in agriculture and food systems massive discovery of genes functions by sequencing and phenotyping the worlds collections of wild and domesticated crop and animal species and using that know how in conventional and biotechnology applications for accelerating next generation crop and animal breeding the revolutions in biological sciences and information technology have put this exciting opportunity at our fingertips potential returns on such investments are huge and broad including for small farms worldwide re engineering crop photosynthesis to increase yields and make crops more resource efficient introducing c photosynthesis into a c crop such as rice could produce more yield for the same amount of sunshine water and nitrogen the metabolic components already exist in c rice plants however the anatomical and biochemical features of c plants must be understood and transferred to rice plants this is currently being pursued by a group of scientists from the international rice research institute irri and advanced institutions around the world in the international c rice consortium who hope to construct a functioning c rice plant within the next years genetic improvements to increase the nitrogen use efficiency in non leguminous crops including engineering a mechanism for fixing atmospheric n into such crop species the three major cereals rice wheat maize account for about of global nitrogen fertilizer consumption a breakthrough in nitrogen use efficiency of such staple crops would help decouple rising food production from rising fertilizer consumption and make farming more profitable cost effective small scale production of ammonia integrated with renewable energy generation to meet local fertilizer supply needs and store energy in fertilizer to buffer intermittent supplies of electrical energy smart fertilizer technologies and or genetic improvements that could double the crop recovery efficiency of applied phosphorus fertilizer typically only of the p applied with fertilizer is recovered by the crop in the first growing season although it can be increased through better nutrient management and stewardship programs in low performing areas new technology could enable increasing short and or long term phosphorus efficiency this would be more profitable for farmers and also reduce the risk of p losses next generation biofuels and other bioenergy solutions that are more energy efficient use crop residues and biomass waste and dont consume more agricultural land or natural ecosystems environment independent self sustained skyfarming or other forms of vertical urban agriculture and horticulture as part of local food chains semi autonomous farm robots for precision farming at different scales including for performing tasks that are difficult laborious or dangerous to humans edible commercially viable synthetic meat grown under controlled energy efficient conditions to replace livestock products new products made from agricultural by products and waste including recycling of chemical elements for other uses innovative payment and digital monitoring schemes for environmental services that incentivize the implementation of high ecological and social standards at landscape scale food market system innovations that can incentivize species and landscape diversity in agriculture e g whole new storage facilities and computerized delivery systems for diverse products generally speaking there is a need to i move from supply driven to demand driven agricultural innovation systems that focus on the right priorities including active participation by key stakeholders and ii simplify the increasing complexity fragmentation and lack of coordination of agricultural r d funding new visionary r d funding models are needed that are founded in strategic long term thinking have a clear outcome focus and reward quality science and proven impact enable public private collaboration in r d and extension to cover all areas sufficiently and make build human capital faster progress encourage open access to information data and other intellectual properties create a viable market for r d outputs and innovation services enhance cross border learning cooperation and technology spillover stimulate more private investments in r d and direct it to areas of public interest including attracting new investors such as venture capital and social impact investors systematically improve public r d infrastructure and planning and implementing action implementation of the new sdgs through targets indicators planning and investments should be scalable from local to global levels and must also be measureable at all levels and scales the pathways towards more sustainable agriculture and food systems will vary by country as well as within countries but could follow some common principles box in every village there is a huge diversity of households from relatively better off to abjectly poor each country and each locality must choose its own agricultural transformation paths and prioritize concrete solutions for them market driven economic and technological growth will not be sufficient to achieve the necessary deep transformation of the global food system because it lacks the incentives to confront all of the challenges that need to be tackled good governance supported by good metrics needs to direct the transformation process not all goals of sustainable agriculture and food systems can be achieved immediately and simultaneously because the challenges and uncertainties are simply too large and complex perfect quick solutions rarely exist multiple actionable changes are the basis for moving towards achieving a major goal a risk minimization strategy also offers greater potential for ownership and building consensus that results in real change its goal is to find ways of moving forward rather than seeking ultimate solutions that do not address the diverse pressing needs of different countries which too often result in no action being taken it may also include drastic actions that may have to be taken in certain cases such as policies and good governance mechanisms that slow down and halt the destruction of forests or natural wetlands the depletion of water resources and the conversion of fertile agricultural land into housing and industrial zones or provide the necessary controls over food quality and safety planning for success requires an implementation plan that provides a roadmap to realize strategic goals while the high level sdgs for the post era will galvanize the global community to work towards shared development goals country by country as well as local implementation plans will be required to achieve the targets national and local governments need to take the lead in developing and implementing their own sustainable development strategies and action plans at different levels based on the proposed sai principles and the four dimensions of sustainable development improved measurement of development outputs and outcomes has to be an integral part of this but moving beyond high level global goals will also require solid business plans for development that provide a roadmap for success countries and local stakeholders need to enter the sustainable development path in the right order by defining their priorities and assessing the feasibility of different options action planning needs to be goal oriented and systematic national and local governments should apply structured assessment and business planning methodologies to analyze how various solutions could contribute to meeting one or more specific targets and what the cost of different options is researchers must play an important role in guiding this process a structured assessment and backcasting approach typically includes five steps background analysis data collection past trends and future projections possible scenarios analyze data on problem relevance define and characterize key problems opportunities assess different technology policy solutions assumptions timeframes effectiveness cost etc estimate outcomes and effects at scale direct and indirect effects modeling of large scale impact on development goals targets direct and indirect sectoral and cross sectoral benefits cost vs benefits interesting examples have recently been demonstrated for assessing technology paths for decarbonizing californias energy supply through such a backcasting approach or for climate change adaptation planning in ethiopia box some guiding principles for implementing sustainable agricultural intensification governments and international agencies should make sustainable development of agriculture a priority and support it through larger and sustained investments the domestic private sector composed of millions of farmers and other local businesses is by far the biggest investor in agriculture and must be at the center of agricultural development strategies and plans countries should weigh the costs benefits and potential tradeoffs of specific steps to take but within a generic framework that aims to achieve transformative changes countries need to constantly adjust their own policies to remove barriers take advantage of new technologies and create incentives for farmers technology developers and the investment community to develop workable options for deploying into agricultural systems agricultural productivity growth in cereals and other staple food crops cannot be compromised because it is essential for eradicating poverty and hunger improvement of agriculture and food systems is a continuous iterative process involving many public civil society and private sector stakeholders many small steps must be taken involving learning as well as requiring behavior change by all actors involved multi faceted approaches are needed to respond to the diversity of farmers environments objectives constraints and incentives and to ensure proper targeting thinking policies and technologies from developed countries cannot be simply transferred to developing and transition countries to dictate what is right or wrong but all opportunities for north south as well as south south sharing and learning should be exploited specific attention must be paid to increasing the resilience of crop and livestock systems adapting agriculture to climate change and climatic extremes reducing the water intensity of crop production better nutrient management improved animal health and halting the expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems of ecological high value greater equity is needed in terms of access to inputs and markets throughout the world to help smallholders escape from poverty and resource depletion traps farming and the broader rural agribusiness sector must provide attractive social and economic development opportunities for people living in rural areas particularly women and the hundreds of millions of young people who will soon be looking for jobs women are key drivers of change in agriculture they need to be empowered along the whole value chain from equal access to land to opportunities for small business development in the agriculture and food sector better support systems are needed on the ground to accelerate progress including more professional extension systems mobile phone technology soil data real time weather data reference research information crop information etc implementing sai should include efforts to integrate agriculture with other sectors to have greater impact particularly on health natural resource management disaster risk reduction gender education and energy multiple stakeholders must be encouraged to participate in the sai process programs and policy measures should encourage business development public private partnerships and other measures through which a variety of sectors can work together on the ground the engagement of farmers communities and consumers should increase biophysical economic social and environmental metrics need to be collected in a comprehensive reliable manner to assess different policy and technology options make the right choices and evaluate the performance of agriculture over time countries should adopt open data policies political will is needed to implement a more coordinated and business approach to development including behavior change on the part of all participants one of the major challenges is the alignment of many actors who play different roles in development to ensure strategies are translated into tangible outputs and outcomes to improve food security and nutrition for the rural and urban poor one initiative which has shown some success is the development of innovation platforms to foster linkages between the many players in a specific value chain these innovation platforms or innovation hubs bring together the public and private sectors research and development and actors at different places in the value chain to contribute to local innovation and strengthened chains local and national governments are often overwhelmed by disparate programs operating within their borders but such platforms can give a solid base from which to drive action which is well coordinated the range of organizations to coordinate with includes sustainable agriculture platforms and roundtables national governments and local authorities national agricultural research and extension systems universities civil society organizations csos including farmers associations private companies and industry associations un organizations such as fao wfp unep undp and oecd global and regional political bodies and organizations global regional and national initiatives e g caadp g alliance for food security and nutrition agra african fertilizer and agribusiness partnership afap global partnership on nutrient management gpnm global dryland alliance gdla scaling up nutrition sun etc large business led development corridors e g wef new vision for agriculture e g sai platform www saiplatform org and initiatives platforms donors development banks and funds private foundations and social impact investors international agricultural research centers e g those forming the cgiar and the association of international research and development centers for agriculture airca while many of these stakeholders have common goals there is relatively little coordination among them along a commodity value chain in most developing countries compared to developed economies often implementation measures to increase farm productivity and profitability is hampered by partners not knowing how individual initiatives stitch together to support a robust and safe food system the diversity of uncoordinated projects operating within a given country leads to fragmented unsustainable investments that seldom reach large scale key steps towards addressing this critical issue include comprehensive national and sub national agricultural development strategies and investment plans which follow an integrated inclusive approach are evidence based and are driven by the needs of smallholder farmers and local entrepreneurs to become successful in producing processing and marketing nutritious safe food in an efficient and equitable manner laws policies and implementation offices that guide and coordinate the activities of multiple actors and ensure transparency and accountability of development partners for outputs in support of national development goals establishment of scalable systems that support stakeholder engagement sharing of information and practices measurement sustainability goal setting training extension etc so that diverse stakeholders can focus their resources on making a meaningful difference the use of modern tools e g mobile phones satellite imagery geospatial databases to foster linkages along value chains and stronger coordination and engagement with farmers to increase the adoption of ecological intensification practices scorecards that leverage digital technologies to provide more granular feedback to governments on their progress towards sdgs across sectors including the contributions of multiple actors involved there is a need for partner mapping within each country to enable organizations within regions and along different commodity value chains to self assemble and make strategic contributions to increase value chain efficiency reduce duplication and provide farmer preferred inputs and services while supporting equitable market opportunities for smallholder farmers and their families providing the tools many digitally enabled to support value chain coordination and efficiency gains in service of farm families will be vital for success mechanisms indicators and scorecards should be created that incentivize organizations to take ownership and become more effective in reducing poverty and increasing agriculture productivity in a sustainable manner one example of this is the development of seed roadmaps to ensure crop improvement programs are placing appropriate emphasis on the markets and traits important to farmers through participatory testing and then build out seed production and distribution plans in partnership with a wide range of local partners this deliberate approach to variety development and seed production and distribution puts in place the targets needed to realize national seed requirements for farmer and market preferred crops countries and international donors need to make strong investments in the public sector but they should also enable more sustainable business investment by creating infrastructure providing security stopping corruption protecting human rights encouraging education and more this is one of the prerequisites for leveraging large private sector investments in smallholder farming and food systems in developing countries with these in place private investments will grow and publicprivate partnerships ppp could flourish as a mechanism for implementing concrete solutions in different farming situations and food chains there is a growing desire on the part of governments universities international institutions and civil society organizations csos to work with the private sector and vice versa experience so far shows that ppps are easy to talk about but often hard to make work nevertheless some good examples have already emerged in recent years which have demonstrated success or promise at different scales such as smallholder input and service delivery systems product supply chains r d and large scale investment corridors box the latter while offering potential solutions should be developed in close consultation with local stakeholders particularly the current land users there is also a need for alternative funding approaches that complement the traditional funding of r d pull mechanisms are results based financial incentives that reward successful innovations and their adoption to overcome market failure and stimulate more private sector engagement in r d agresults launched by the g in is a new global initiative to enhance smallholder welfare and improve food security for the poor and vulnerable through the use of pull mechanisms in agriculture moving agriculture towards more sustainable productivity will require policy coherence and innovation box these must often be coordinated within and across countries to achieve transformative change needed policy reforms include those that increase support for the rural sector by improving infrastructure strengthening capacities along value chain actors and stimulating innovation economies that are heavily dependent on agriculture sometimes tend to tax their rural sectors in favor of urban and industrial sectors however policies that support agriculture as well as rural infrastructure and enterprise will benefit the majority of the population including the urban sector a comparison with experiences from middle income countries in southeast asia reveals for example that i the historical roots of economic success lie in pro poor agricultural and rural development policies ii even when it has been pro rural african development strategy has often not necessarily been pro poor and iii pro poor agricultural development not export oriented industrialization should be the first priority of african states seeking to achieve sustained growth and poverty reduction a key policy objective will be the support of capacity strengthening for the various stakeholder groups that are important for rural development this includes farmers with youth and women requiring particular attention extension box examples of public private partnerships and business initiatives in agriculture and food systems unilever kenyan tea

now being rolled out by the kenyan tea development agency to farmers eco certification is a key element in this partnership hybrid rice development consortium hrdc small medium and large seed companies engaged in hybrid rice breeding and commercialization need to have access to traits breeding materials breeding support and other information generated by public sector research the hybrid rice development consortium hrdc was established by the international rice research institute irri in as a ppp model to advance hybrid rice development it currently has private businesses and public sector institutions as members members of the hrdc provide feedback on hybrid rice research priorities private sector members provide financial support through annual membership and germplasm fees and in return gain access to diverse germplasm and other benefits including training hrdc members can also seek bilateral collaboration with irri and other public sector partners this mechanism has allowed irri to increase its hybrid rice breeding capacity in a demand driven self sustained manner within four years it has led to a fold increase in the volume of germplasm shared with both private and public members of the hrdc http hrdc irri org sustainable agriculture initiative platform food industries are the biggest purchasers of agricultural raw materials in order to rely on a constant

agricultural growth corridors in burkina faso ethiopia ghana kenya mozambique rwanda and tanzania partners include the governments of these countries international donors development organizations and private companies http growafrica com services including non governmental groups as well as enterprises that provide services and support value chains such as those involved in finance input supply transportation drying milling and marketing government policies on agricultural inputs such as seeds fertilizers pesticides and machinery are of particular importance for agriculture but they sometimes provide wrong incentives or result in barriers that slow down progress well targeted fertilizer subsidies play a major role in increasing productivity and halting soil nutrient depletion particularly in sub saharan africa but fertilizer subsidies can also lead to excessive or imbalanced use or become a major economic burden for a country if they become permanent large entitlements that do not encourage adoption of better management practices machines are often handed out for free or at highly subsidized prices but without an agribusiness sector that provides the necessary training and service many break down quickly and end up in machine graveyards that can be found in many developing countries this contrasts with a very different successful model the small machines revolution engines pumps hand tractors tillers that powered the green revolution in asia which was largely driven by local entrepreneurs could this be a suitable model for africa what policies could enable it generally speaking input subsidies or credit schemes should become market smart and target smallholders and small entrepreneurs e g through vouchers grants or loans to promote private sector solutions they should be temporary not permanent and they should be contract based with mechanisms that ensure that contracts are being honored by everyone in the chain intellectual property rights ipr regulations for acquiring sharing import and export of germplasm variety release systems seed laws seed subsidies and other seed related policies to a large extent influence progress in breeding the development of a vibrant seed industry with numerous local businesses and affordable access to new varieties by farmers this is a rapidly changing area in which countries constantly need to adjust their policies to address emerging technology opportunities barriers to innovation that slow down the time to market or increase the cost of getting a new product to market to a level that is only affordable by few companies with sufficient resources need to be removed for the majority of crops it typically takes years to breed test release and disseminate seed of a new variety to farmers this slow process is one of the reasons why many farmers cannot take advantage of better varieties the time from a cross made to quality seed in the hands of a farmer can be cut in half through modern breeding technologies and the right government policies and support mechanisms for speeding up release and seed commercialization through public and private channels in india maize and pearl millet yields grew significantly during the last two decades due partly to a combination of public policies that encouraged private investment in india s seed industry and intellectual property rights conferred by hybridization that addressed both the private sector s need for ownership as well as the nation s need for productivity growth governments should design and implement national policies that are modeled after the voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests in the context of national food security in many countries this may require placing constraints on the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture or policies that minimize the loss of productive agricultural land to industrialization and urbanization economic land management water resource management e g water pricing and ecosystem restoration science based fisheries policy and governance reforms are needed to promote a complementary role of sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture and safeguard the diversity of global fish stocks information and communications technologies icts have much to offer for enhancing planning and implementation of agricultural transformation processes while icts cannot replace interpersonal interactions digital communications can certainly enhance information exchange and provide the analytical power needed for planning decision making real time feedback and other forms of instruments should be used for sustainable evaluation besides the possibility of inexpensive provision of information to populations who are otherwise relatively isolated icts have the potential to foster exchange of information among households and communities as well as crowd sourcing of data and opinions box the enabling role of agricultural policies new technologies are important but policy and institutional reforms will be needed to align producer and consumer incentives and thus implement transformative changes in agriculture and food systems the general principles chapter goals and targets for sustainable development chapter as well as the available solutions for sai chapter provide overall guidance for priority setting and choosing policy options transparency inclusiveness good monitoring critical review and dynamic adaptation of policies to specific changing contexts will determine whether the stated targets can be met development of policies is by nature politically driven based on the specific challenges faced in each country agricultural policies should support systems based approaches to improving sustainability performance on site specific levels across nations and regions they must be developed with extensive stakeholder engagement to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered and included the outcomes of these policies must be monitored well through suitable indicators some of which could be internationally agreed and others nationally defined countries through their policies should aim to incentivize action by all actors towards more sustainable agricultural production and food consumption practices they should stimulate not distort the development of a vibrant competitive agribusiness sector that serves the needs of farmers and consumers critical areas to improve include policies on agricultural trade and market access prices financing food processing and safety consumer behavior agricultural inputs and subsidies land tenure water rights and use access to knowledge and technology rural infrastructure and labor agricultural research and extension systems protection of ecosystems and use of ecosystem services as well as gender roles rural education and health many will require substantial institutional reforms in many countries countries in which the poorest households spend a large share of their income on food need to pay special attention to the stability of food prices and establish the necessary safety nets and social protection mechanisms regulation or protection are an important part of good policy setting and governance but such tools should be used with care focusing on specific areas such as protecting the poor ensuring food safety or protecting vulnerable natural assets particularly forests water and fish stocks countries should also aim to share their experiences and align critical policies to overcome present barriers for technology development and adoption and thus make faster progress in meeting their own targets actual implementation of policies must be monitored rigorously and due attention should be given to policy research to establish causality between specific policy initiatives and progress toward policy goals concluding remarks the unique opportunity to eradicate poverty and hunger in our generation and make agriculture and food systems more sustainable should not be missed the primary objective of agriculture which cannot be compromised is to produce enough food to sustainably feed or billion people by this largely needs to be accomplished by crop and animal productivity increases reducing food losses and waste and changing diets always keeping in mind that the earths natural resource base is finite in addition to the already common pressures of the past our generation is facing new challenges how to make sure that we do not run out of water how to preserve or improve soils how to adapt to climatic extremes is the best future for many smallholder farmers to get out of farming how do we create better jobs and higher incomes for them in rural or urban areas how do we ensure healthier diets and lifestyles in all countries we live in an ever changing world in terms of population resource demands and constraints climate and even political volatility meeting future food demand will require shifts in behavior as well as shifts towards more sophisticated technologies information and knowledge management systems for farming systems and whole value chains but also policy making and market and incentive systems for investment in ecosystem services we need to be realistic about the future of smallholder farming in developing countries for many small farming households exiting the agricultural sector may be the best strategy to overcome current poverty traps caused by resource constraints that also restrict the adoption of better technologies access to better education and jobs may offer future generations a chance for a different perspective on life while those who remain in farming may have a greater chance to consolidate land holdings and thus modernize many operations for greater income potential the to period must become a period of serious transition towards food systems that operate based on sai principles it is possible to effectively end extreme poverty and hunger during this period but it will probably take longer to completely halt and reverse all of the negative environmental and health impacts of contemporary food systems however if political will governance and human behavior can change as rapidly as science and technology emerge policy coherence for development sustainable agriculture and food systems can become the new global standard not the exception prosperous healthy and resilient rural communities will be needed to produce the worlds future food in a sustainable manner concerted coordinated action is needed with increased sustained investment in agriculture and rural development we need to make farming more precise and more attractive to systematically improve sustainability performance using new technology we need new implementation models that can unlock the real potential of the public and private sectors in addressing complex problems including monitoring learning and prudently adapting markets alone are not enough the private sector will also have to change its business models and good governance will be essential including more restraint in exploiting critical resources such as land water and forests aspirations of maximum consumption should be replaced by patterns of optimized consumption the available technical solutions are well advanced but we also need to overcome systemic political economic and social barriers to change which are substantial strong multi sectoral cooperation will be needed to address the development challenges facing humanity and

and livestock commodities and countries regions linked through international trade and food production units demand is a function of prices income and population growth crop production is determined by crop and input prices the rate of productivity growth and water availability the underlying data and model used make many assumptions about the future trajectories of food demand and supply uncertainties associated with such projections are generally large and so are differences among countries and regions this business as usual scenario assumes a continuation of current trends and food consumption agricultural policies and investments in agricultural productivity growth population growth is the median variant of the un projections esa un org wpp real prices for major agricultural commodities continue to rise due to increasing demand population growth and per capita consumption increasing agricultural land prices and land and water constraints to expanding production meat consumption accelerates in developing countries but also continues to increase in developed countries global per capita consumption of meat would rise from kg in to kg in and kg in total meat production would grow by in relative to and by in global per capita consumption of cereals would rise from kg in to kg in and kg in cereals production would grow by in relative to and by in world harvested crop area would increase putting additional pressure on natural resources use of fertilizers and other inputs would continue to rise at current rates productivity and efficiency gains would be too small to significantly reduce the negative environmental impacts of agriculture it would also be difficult to eradicate poverty and food insecurity the number of people at risk of hunger would only decline by around from million in to million in the number of malnourished children would only decline by about from million to million this scenario illustrates some of the key principles and interactions involved in addressing multiple development goals through changes in agriculture and food systems productivity increases play a key role in achieving the targets of future sustainable agriculture however to eradicate poverty hunger and other forms of malnutrition by crop and animal productivity growth rates would need to be higher than in the bau scenario furthermore achieving all of the targets of sustainable agriculture and food systems including better environmental stewardship protection of natural resources and healthier human beings requires deeper transformative changes in how the world consumes and produces food it can probably not be achieved through productivity and efficiency increases alone annex sustainable development goals and targets proposed by the

extreme poverty in all its forms the sdgs reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting economic development social inclusion environ mental sustainability and good governance including peace and security these goals reaffirm human rights and underscore the right to development as central objectives they are universal and apply to all countries national and local governments businesses and civil society sustainable development will require that the goals be pursued in combination rather than individually or one at a time goal end extreme poverty including hungercc end extreme poverty in all its forms mdgs including hunger child stunting malnutrition and food insecurity support highly vulnerable countries target a end absolute income poverty or less per day and hunger including achieving food security and appropriate nutrition and ending child stunting mdg other suitably revised targets of mdgs included here or below target b target c provide enhanced support for highly vulnerable states and least developed countries to address the structural challenges facing those countries including violence and conflict goal achieve development within planetary boundaries all countries have a right to development that respects planetary boundaries ensures sustainable production and consumption patterns and helps to stabilize the global population by mid century target a each country reaches at least the next income level as defined by the world bank dd target b countries report on their contribution to planetary boundaries and incorporate them

reproductive health rights in countries with total fertility rates above children per woman and a bb preamble based on the rio outcome document cc the term hunger as used here embraces various things including child stunting food insecurity and malnutrition appropriate indicators will need to be chosen to reflect the full spectrum of what constitutes hunger dd e g low income countries become at least lower middle income countries continuation of voluntary fertility reductions in countries where total fertility rates are above replacement level goal ensure effective learning for all children and youth for life and livelihood all girls and boys complete affordable and high quality early childhood development programs and primary and secondary education to prepare them for the challenges of modern life and decent livelihoods all youth and adults have access to continuous lifelong learning to acquire functional literacy numeracy and skills to earn a living through decent employment or

and tools for analysis decision making and communication many composite indices and other decision or communication tools have been proposed in recent years to score multiple functions of agriculture and food systems generally speaking many of them suffer from three basic shortcomings i the quality of the underlying component data ii scoring of qualitative data and ii correlation and weighting of the various quantitative or qualitative component indicators nevertheless composite indices have an important role to play in communicating to a broader audience the multiple dimensions of food security and sustainable agricultural development in user friendly numbers charts and tables they are thus an integral part of decision making and implementation strategies aimed at changing behavior and triggering more action at different levels in general composite indices footprint tools or similar approaches should be i science based ii outcome and action oriented iii applicable at different scales from the farm and value chain scale where the change must happen to the national scale where progress towards meeting targets must be measured iv capable of measuring trends over time and v primarily based on credible publicly available data preference should be given to tools that are based on well defined measurable components that can stand on their own and are also linked to key indicators for measuring progress towards achieving sdg targets see chapter for illustration we provide six different examples the global hunger index ghi is designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger globally and by country and region calculated each year the ghi aims to highlight successes and failures in hunger reduction raise awareness and help understand regional and country differences in hunger to trigger further action to reflect the multidimensional nature of hunger the ghi combines three equally weighted indicators into one index number undernourishment the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population child underweight the proportion of children under age of five who are underweight and child mortality the mortality rate of children under age of five www ifpri org book ourwork researcharea global hunger index the global food security index gfsi considers four core issues of food security across countries affordability availability quality and safety the index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative scoring model constructed from unique indicators that measures these drivers of food security across both developing and developed countries it includes several unique qualitative indicators many of which relate to government policy to capture drivers of food security which are not currently measured in other international datasets the gfsi is updated on a quarterly basis to adjust for the impact of fluctuating food prices its major goal is to assess in a timely manner which countries are most and least vulnerable to food insecurity foodsecurityindex eiu com the womens empowerment in agriculture index weai measures the empowerment agency and inclusion of women in the agriculture sector to identify ways to overcome those obstacles and constraints it aims to increase understanding of the connections between womens empowerment food security and agricultural growth it measures the roles and extent of womens engagement in the agriculture sector in five domains decisions about agricultural production access to and decision making power over productive resources control over use of income leadership in the community and time use the five domains comprise ten indicators each domain is weighted equally as are each of the indicators within a domain the weai identifies women who are disempowered and tries to understand how autonomy and decision making can be increased the weai is also a useful tool for tracking progress toward gender equality which is one of the current millennium development goals www ifpri org publication womens empowerment agriculture index national water security index nwsi the asian water development outlook measures the overall national water security as the composite result of five interdependent dimensions because a single focus on any of these is insufficient to guide decisions or assess outcomes in the water sector the five dimensions are household water security economic water security urban water security environmental water security and resilience to water related disasters each of the five dimensions is measured on a scale of hazardous exemplary using sub indices indicators for each dimension the nwsi is calculated as the populated weighted average of the five key dimensions of water security and further aggregated up to sub regions countries and regions with a low overall nwsi are described as hot spots where additional efforts and targeted investments are required the nwsi can be used to track progress at country and regional scale towards improving water security as a whole and for its various components www adb org publications asian water development outlook the rice bowl index rbi is a public private sector initiative that aims to provide a platform for joint action between various governmental and non governmental stakeholders the tool serves as a common language for different stakeholders to engage in purposeful dialogue leading to solutions oriented action the rbi consists of a quantitative and a qualitative component which are currently measured for countries in the asia pacific region the quantitative component is a modular diagnostic platform examining the key enablers and disablers of food security the rbi defines these as demand price environmental factors farm level factors and policy and trade each driver is a composite of different metrics and proxies which are measured by using publicly available data such as consumer price index cereal yield arable land food consumption infrastructure and water availability the qualitative component is a white paper and an update is published every months which interprets the platform data and identifies areas which require increased attention in terms of the development of appropriate policy solutions investment in technology and infrastructure and the creation of economic opportunities for farmers and the communities in which they live and work www ricebowlindex com field to market including producer organizations agribusinesses food companies conservation organizations and other not for profit organizations universities and agency partners in the usa it aims to create opportunities across the agricultural supply chain for continuous improvements in productivity environmental quality and human well being a national report is published every four years last report to assess environmental and socioeconomic indicators for measuring outcomes of on farm agricultural production in the united states the report analyzes trends over time in major agricultural crops at the national scale its first part analyzes five environmental indicators land use soil erosion irrigation water applied energy use and greenhouse gas emissions each of which is presented in three formats resource use impact per unit of production resource use impact per acre and total resource use impact for ease of communication trends are shown in spider diagrams for year periods with as reference year in a second part six socioeconomic indicators debt asset ratio returns above variable costs crop production contribution to national and state gross domestic product non fatality injury fatality and labor hours are assessed moreover a fieldprint calculator is available online as an educational tool designed to help farmers assess how their own operational decisions affect overall sustainability performance the calculator is an easy way to find out how a farmers current land use energy use water use greenhouse gas emissions and soil loss compare with state and national averages www fieldtomarket org is an alliance of nearly fifty organizations the sustainable development solutions network sdsn engages scientists engineers
