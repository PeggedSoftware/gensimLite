nature quality services provided distinguishing populations within country wont urban sdg promote separation urban rural areas argue distinct urban rural goals would draw artificial separation urban rural areas yet challenges governance institutional arrangements many countries differ significantly rural urban areas hence separating goals sound analytical institutional operational perspective experience countries across income levels suggests strong urban rural linkages especially around economic employment regional infrastructure ecosystem services important achieving outcomes ending extreme poverty urban sdg would support processes attempt bridge limiting dichotomy isnt urban goal broad unmanageable fear urban goal would become broad therefore unmanageable implementation concern
